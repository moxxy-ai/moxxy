Desktop OAuth providers now sign in for real instead of showing a "run `moxxy login` in a terminal" hint.

Settings → Providers (and the onboarding wizard) drive a shared `OAuthSignIn` flow that spawns `moxxy login <provider>`, opens the browser, and — for out-of-band providers like `claude-code` — collects the pasted `claude setup-token` or `code#state` in the UI (browser-authorize primary, token paste as a fallback). Loopback providers (openai-codex) keep their automatic browser+callback flow.

Mechanics: `moxxy login --stdin-prompts` relays each interactive prompt to the host as a NUL-bracketed marker on stdout (new `encodeLoginPrompt` / `createLoginStreamScanner` in `@moxxy/sdk`) and reads answers as stdin lines, so a GUI host can drive the paste flow without a TTY. The desktop exposes this via new `provider.login.start` / `answer` / `cancel` IPC commands and `provider.login.prompt` / `output` / `done` events; the dead `onboarding.runProviderLogin` command was removed. `onboarding.providerAuthKind` now derives a provider's auth kind from the runner's registry (fixing `claude-code` being mis-detected as an API-key provider) instead of a hardcoded list.
