Desktop: new Settings → **Mobile** tab to enable a mobile gateway and pair a phone by scanning a QR — the mobile app then drives the desktop host exactly like the TUI does.

- **Runtime bridge control.** The opt-in WebSocket bridge (`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`) can now be started and stopped at runtime, not only at boot. A new `MobileGatewayManager` (`apps/desktop/electron/main/ws-bridge.ts`) owns the lifecycle: start (binds the LAN-advertised interface — `0.0.0.0` — so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can reach it), stop (closes the listener + terminates clients), status (running/host/port/token/connectUrl/clientCount), and token rotation (re-keys the live server, dropping every existing client). The on/off preference is persisted to the desktop prefs file (`DesktopPrefs.mobileGatewayEnabled`) so the gateway survives a restart. The env-gated boot path (`MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE=1`) still works for back-compat.
- **New IPC commands** (`@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`, all Zod-validated): `mobileGateway.status`, `mobileGateway.setEnabled(enabled)`, `mobileGateway.rotateToken`, plus a `mobileGateway.changed` event for live status updates. These control the bridge, so they are **host-only** — added to `REMOTE_DISALLOWED_COMMANDS`, the WS bus refuses them so a remote client can never toggle the gateway or read/rotate the pairing token.
- **The QR payload IS the connect URL** (`ws://host:port/?t=<token>`), built with the mobile-channel's pure pairing helpers (split into `@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile/pairing` so the desktop main can import them without the tunnel-provider deps). A test imports the shipped app's own `parsePairingQrPayload` and asserts the desktop's `connectUrl` round-trips through it — proving the QR the desktop emits is exactly what the app accepts.
- **Security:** the gateway is OFF by default and only starts on explicit user action; the LAN bind is the user's opt-in, surfaced with a prominent honest warning in the tab; bearer-token auth via the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol and Origin default-deny stay in force; token rotation invalidates existing connections.
