Performance pack from the 2026-06-09 audit (A39–A42 + A42b): the TUI context meter caches its token estimate per log and folds in only new events instead of re-walking the entire event log (incl. JSON.stringify of every tool result) on every ~30Hz render; the desktop NDJSON chat log keeps a size/mtime-guarded line-offset index so scroll-up pages seek-read only their own byte range instead of re-reading and re-parsing the whole file per page; MemoryStore maintains its MEMORY.md index incrementally (no more O(N) re-read of every memory file per write) and gains a warn-only `maxMemories` soft cap (default 500 — no eviction, memories are user knowledge); goal mode declares its idle nudge as a volatile tail message and the stable-prefix cache strategy places its rolling tail breakpoint before volatile messages, so idle goal iterations re-read the cached prefix instead of paying a guaranteed-wasted cache write; and compactor-summarize now produces a real summary via the session's own provider/model (new optional `provider`/`model` on `CompactContext`), falls back to an honest, clearly-labeled head+tail digest when no provider is reachable, and reports `tokensSaved` from real character deltas instead of the fabricated `slice.length * 30`.
