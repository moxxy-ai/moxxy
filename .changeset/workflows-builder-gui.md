Workflows visual builder GUI (phase 2 of 2): a drag-canvas on desktop + an outline editor on mobile, both built on one shared, DOM-free model.

**New shared model — `@moxxy/workflows-builder`.** A genuinely DOM-free, RN-safe package (zero React, zero DOM, zero node built-ins — proven by the Expo iOS export) that both apps import. It holds: the canvas `BuilderState` + a typed `builderReducer`; pure operations (`addStep`/`removeStep`, `connectNeeds`/`disconnectNeeds`, `setBranchTargets`/`setSwitchCase`, `setLoopBody`/`setLoopExit`/`setLoopConfig`, `moveNode`/`setViewport`/`renameNode`/`updateNode`/`updateMeta`); a `serialize`↔`hydrate` pair that builds a `Workflow` object + `ui.layout` from the canvas and re-derives the node graph (incl. an auto-layout when `ui.layout` is absent); a dependency-free YAML codec scoped to the workflow shape (chosen over the `yaml` package, which reaches for `node:process`, so the RN bundle stays clean — authoritative validation is server-side); and the validate/save bridges that map `workflows.validateDraft` issues back onto the offending nodes. 32 unit tests cover operations, the serialize↔hydrate round-trip (loop body + exit + branches + layout), validation-error mapping, and the loop node's body/exit modeling.

**The loop node's two-region visual model.** A `loop` node exposes (1) a BODY region — the steps that run inside the loop each iteration, toggled in the inspector and rendered as dashed "body" edges — and (2) a single EXIT edge to the next step, taken when the condition is met OR a body step errors, labeled "on done / error → next". The exit is modeled as the body-excluded step that `needs` the loop, so there's always exactly one exit edge and the on-disk schema is unchanged.

**Desktop canvas (`apps/desktop/src/workflows/`).** `WorkflowsPanel` becomes a list↔builder switcher (keeping enable/disable + run-now + last-run, adding per-row Edit + New). The builder is a hand-rolled SVG drag-canvas (no react-flow — the graph is ≤40 nodes, so a graph lib's bundle cost wasn't justified): color-coded node cards per step kind, derived `needs`/branch/loop edges with labels, draggable nodes that persist x/y to `ui.layout`, a node inspector (edits each kind's action fields incl. the loop's body/exit/condition/maxIterations), an add-node palette, live validation that decorates the offending node, and Save (`validateDraft`→`save`). 7 testing-library tests.

**Mobile editor (`apps/mobile/`).** New `app/workflow-edit.tsx` screen + `WorkflowEditor` component + `useWorkflowEditor` hook, consuming the same shared model over the mobile frame bridge (new `buildWorkflowValidateFrame`/`buildWorkflowSaveFrame`/`buildWorkflowDetailFrame`, wired to the `MobileSessionHost` handlers the engine added). v1 is an OUTLINE editor (a node list with the same operations, incl. the loop's body/exit/condition), not a touch-drag canvas — a graphical touch canvas was disproportionate for v1.

**Shared IPC glue.** `client-core` gains `useWorkflowBuilder` (DOM-free) that drives `workflows.getRun`/`validateDraft`/`save` over the injected transport — the Electron preload bridge on desktop, the WebSocket bridge on mobile — so the validate/save flow is identical across platforms.
