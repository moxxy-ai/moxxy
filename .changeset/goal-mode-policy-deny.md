Goal-mode auto-approve now respects user permission policy (audit A3). `PermissionResolver` gains an optional prompt-free `policyCheck(call, ctx)` (implemented by core's policy wrapper) that returns the engine/tool-rule decision without ever falling through to an interactive prompt. Goal mode consults it before auto-allowing, so `~/.moxxy/permissions.json` deny rules now deny in unattended runs — previously the auto-approve resolver replaced the whole policy chain, silently ignoring them.
