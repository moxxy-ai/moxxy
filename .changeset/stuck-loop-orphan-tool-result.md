Fix tool calls getting stuck "running" forever (flipping to error only on the next message). When the stuck-loop detector tripped, `mode-tool-use` (the default mode) and `mode-goal` ended the turn after emitting `tool_call_requested` but before running the call — orphaning it with no `tool_result`. The turn still completed (re-enabling the composer), so the orphaned call spun indefinitely until the next `user_prompt` swept it into an error. Both modes now synthesize a failed result for every already-emitted request before bailing, matching the abort path and the already-correct plan-execute/developer modes. This also stops the provider from rejecting the unresolved tool-use block on the following turn.
