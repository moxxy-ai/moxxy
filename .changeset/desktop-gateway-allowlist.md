Desktop mobile gateway: deny-by-default remote command allow-list + gateway hardening.

**Security fix (critical/high).** The runtime mobile gateway (Settings → Mobile, PR #141) wired the desktop's COMPLETE IPC handler set onto the WebSocket bus and bound the LAN wildcard. The only per-command filter for remote clients was a blocklist that omitted host-mutating commands — so a paired phone (or anyone on the LAN with the bearer token) could invoke `session.setAutoApprove` (disable the desktop's approval prompts, then run any tool unattended), `desks.create`/`rename`/`remove`, `onboarding.saveProviderKey`/`openExternal`, `app.updateCli`/`checkUpdate`/`updateDashboard`, vault/settings/prefs writes, and more — a privilege-escalation / RCE-adjacent hole.

The model is now **allow-by-default-deny**. `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract` exports `REMOTE_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` — the single source of truth for the remote/mobile trust surface (the exact commands a paired chat client needs: session info/runTurn/abort/setMode/newSession/runCommand, transcribe, ask RESPOND, connection discovery/retry, the per-workspace transcript log, and `workflows.list`/`run`/`getRun`). `@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`'s `WebSocketCommandBus` rejects any command not on the list with a coded error, regardless of what handlers the host registered. The Electron (renderer) bus keeps full access — only the WS/remote bus is restricted. `REMOTE_DISALLOWED_COMMANDS` is kept (deprecated) for renderer affordance-gating but no longer drives enforcement.

**Finding 2 (medium).** Workflow AUTHORING is host-only: `workflows.save`, `workflows.validateDraft`, and `workflows.setEnabled` are NOT on the remote allow-list — a paired phone cannot rewrite or re-enable the host's workflows. Read + run (`list`/`getRun`/`run`) stay allowed.

**Finding 3 (medium, stability).** `MobileGatewayManager` start/stop/setEnabled/rotate/resume now serialize through a lifecycle lock, so a rapid off→on toggle (or a boot resume racing a user toggle) can't double-bind the port or leak a LAN-bound listener.

**Finding 4 (medium).** Token rotation is now coherent with a pinned `MOXXY_WS_TOKEN`: rotation is a no-op-with-warning when the env token pins the credential (it can't be rotated from here without diverging the advertised connectUrl from the live accepted token), and `status()`/`connectUrl` always reflect the live accepted token.

**Finding 5 (medium, security UX).** The Mobile tab warning now states plainly that the connection is unencrypted plain `ws://`, so anyone on the network can passively intercept the pairing token and all traffic without the QR — use only on trusted networks.

The standalone `moxxy mobile` host (`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`) is its own trust surface (it registers a curated single-session subset) and opts out of the contract allow-list via `new WebSocketCommandBus({ allowedCommands: null })`. The wave-5 hardening (Origin default-deny, bearer subprotocol auth, connection caps, slow-reader eviction) is unchanged and still applies on the runtime-gateway path.
