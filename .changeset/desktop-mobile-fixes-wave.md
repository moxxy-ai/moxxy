Wave of desktop/mobile fixes. Runner protocol v6 (additive): clients can supply the turn id (`runTurn.turnId`) so renderer per-turn filters actually match — fixing the silently-broken "generate skill with AI" flow and hidden-turn leaks — and `attach` gains a replay policy (`'full' | 'none' | { tail }`) with EventLog rebase so the desktop no longer replays full session history on app start/desk switch (history comes from the paginated NDJSON log). Desktop settings gain a shared "ask moxxy to do it" background-agent modal: the skill generator is refactored onto it and MCP servers and Providers get Add buttons driving `mcp_add_server`/`provider_add`, with permission asks surfaced in-modal (plus a global ask fallback outside the chat view). Subagents now inherit the parent's resolved model: hallucinated model ids warn and fall back, workflow-trigger spawns use the session's last resolved model, and hardcoded model-id fallbacks are gone. Clerk sign-in returns to the app instead of stranding on the hosted My-account page (explicit fallback redirect URLs + a main-process account-portal recovery handler). Workflow canvas: Delete/Backspace removes the selected node and dropping a connector on empty canvas opens an insert-node menu. Mobile: reconnects re-prime the connection store (fixes the deaf "Connected" state after a runner restart), gateway URL commits on blur, the redundant header actions toggle is gone, menu entries are chips, executed tools open a diagnostics panel on tap, and the QR scanner starts scanning immediately.
