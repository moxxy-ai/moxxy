feat(reflector): swappable `reflector` registry category + `@moxxy/reflector-default` learning loop.

A new single-active registry category — the learning-loop block that watches a finished turn and *proposes* memory/skill improvements without ever writing silently. Mirrors the `eventStore` category across all 7 layers (config `plugins.reflector.default`, SDK `ReflectorDef`/`ReflectContext`/`ReflectionProposal` contract + plugin slot, core `ReflectorRegistry`, host registry-kind wiring, session field + `services('reflectors')`, CLI apply/category-swap, catalog), but NULLABLE: core seeds no floor, so reflection is opt-in (like transcriber/synthesizer).

`@moxxy/reflector-default` (discovery-loaded) ships the default `ReflectorDef` `'default'` AND the driver in one plugin. The driver's `onTurnEnd` runs a cheap gate (≥5 tool results OR ≥1 error OR ≥8 mode iterations) under a one-reflection-per-session budget, then fires the reflection FIRE-AND-FORGET so it never blocks or throws into the turn. The reflector does one cheap side-channel LLM pass over a turn digest and returns 0-2 proposals; those are delivered as a ONE-TIME nudge on the next `onBeforeProviderCall`, phrased so the model MAY call `memory_save` / `synthesize_skill` — which still hit their own permission prompts. No silent writes. Graceful no-provider / provider-error skips; `memory_save` and `synthesize_skill` are declared as optional requirements. User-model injection of proposals is deferred to a follow-up PR.
