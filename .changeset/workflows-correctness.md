Workflows round-2 correctness: gate the unshippable `awaitInput` resume, make the visual builder work on the desktop, and fix loop/validation correctness.

**`awaitInput` is gated (was a hang-forever dead-end).** The executor can pause + checkpoint an `awaitInput` step, but the resume trigger/channel that delivers the operator's reply never shipped to `main` — `resumeWorkflowRun` had zero production callers. So an agent-drafted "ask me, then act" workflow would pause forever, leak a retained child session for the process lifetime, and orphan a checkpoint file. `awaitInput` is now **rejected at validate/save time** with a clear "requires the resume channel, not available in this build" message, and `draft.ts` no longer teaches it (it steers the author to `inputs` fields instead). Defense-in-depth: the CLI runner treats a `paused` result as non-terminal (no inbox delivery), `Session.close()` clears retained child sessions so they can't leak, and a `WorkflowRunStore.sweepStale()` sweeper (7-day TTL, run on workflows boot) reaps orphaned `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` checkpoints. The executor pause/resume path is kept intact so re-enabling is a matter of landing a resume trigger and removing the schema gate.

**Visual builder works on the desktop now.** The desktop drives a `RemoteSession`, whose workflows view only forwarded `list`/`setEnabled`/`run` — so the builder's `validateDraft`/`save`/`getRun` were `undefined` and threw "not supported on this session". Added a `workflow.validateDraft|save|getRun` runner-RPC family (**protocol bumped to v4**) with RemoteSession client methods + server handlers, so the desktop builder validates/saves/loads against the runner.

**Loop + validation correctness.** A condition/switch step used as a loop body is rejected (its branch routing was silently ignored). A non-loop-body step that `needs` a loop-body step is rejected (it would stall — body steps are excluded from the main DAG). A loop-body step's own `when` guard and any `needs` other than its loop step / a sibling body step are rejected (body steps run unconditionally each iteration). Logic-step `vars` now drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prototype-pollution guard). Paused-run checkpoints persist + restore `vars` set before the pause. Renaming a workflow via the builder removes the old file/entry instead of leaving an orphaned duplicate (`save(workflow, previousName)`, threaded through the view → IPC → runner RPC → builder hook).
