New `@moxxy/channel-kit` package: shared channel-building machinery extracted from the Telegram and Slack channels (throttled send-once-then-edit FramePump, turnId-filtered turn running + single-flight TurnCoordinator, host-code and TOFU pairing state machines, env→vault secret resolution, audited allow-list permissions, and the inbound-webhook ingest HTTP scaffold + delivery dedupe cache). plugin-telegram and plugin-channel-slack are refactored onto it with no behavior change, so upcoming channels (Discord, WhatsApp, Signal) can be thin adapters.
