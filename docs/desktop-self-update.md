# Desktop self-update (hot-update the app without reinstalling)

The **MoxxyAI Workspaces** desktop updates itself **without making users download
and reinstall a new binary** for the common case. Most of the app is JavaScript —
only the Electron/Chromium/Node shell is a true binary — so a release ships as a
small signed JS bundle that the app verifies and swaps in on the next launch.

This is the same trust model the app already uses to update the bundled
`@moxxy/cli` (install into writable userData, prefer it over the bundled copy):
here it's the desktop's **own** renderer + main + preload + IPC contract.

---

## Two tiers

| | What changes | Mechanism | User experience |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** (≈ every release) | renderer, main process, preload, **IPC/protocol**, any JS | Signed **app bundle** downloaded into `<userData>/app/<version>/`, activated on next launch | Banner → "Update" → relaunch. **No binary download.** |
| **Tier 2** (rare) | Electron / Chromium / Node version, native-module ABI | `electron-updater` against GitHub Releases | Win/Linux: background download + install on restart. macOS: disabled (`shell-updater.ts` no-ops — Squirrel.Mac needs a signed app); the Tier-1 "needs a full app update" banner links the release page instead. |

Tier 1 covers protocol/IPC changes safely because the renderer and the main
process that talk to each other always come from the **same** bundle — there's
never a version skew. You can rename/add/remove IPC commands freely.

---

## How Tier 1 works

```
package.json#main → dist-electron/main/bootstrap.js   ← the immutable "floor" (in the signed .app)
                         │
                         │ verify + pick
                         ▼
   <userData>/app/<version>/dist-electron/main/index.js   ← hot-updatable bundle (if present + valid)
        else  <app>/dist-electron/main/index.js           ← bundled floor
```

1. **Bootstrap (`apps/desktop/electron/main/bootstrap.ts`)** is the only piece a
   hot-update can never replace. It picks which bundle's real `index.js` to load,
   verifying first. The verify/resolve logic + the baked public key are inlined
   into `bootstrap.js`, so the gate lives in the part an attacker can't swap.
2. **The real main** resolves its preload + renderer relative to its own
   `import.meta.dirname`, so loading the userData copy automatically uses that
   copy's preload + `dist/`. The whole bundle moves together. The main's
   `@moxxy/*` workspace deps are inlined into `dist-electron` by electron-vite
   (`BUNDLED_WORKSPACE_DEPS` in `apps/desktop/electron.vite.config.ts`), so both
   the floor and a hot bundle are self-contained — the packaged app ships no
   workspace `node_modules`.
3. **The updater** (`@moxxy/desktop-host/app-update`, surfaced via the
   `app.checkUpdate` / `app.updateDashboard` IPC, the update dashboard panel +
   launch banner) resolves the newest **published** `desktop-v*` release via the
   GitHub Releases API (semver-highest; drafts + prereleases skipped), verifies
   its manifest, downloads + hash-checks the gzipped bundle, extracts into a
   fresh `*.incoming-*` dir, re-verifies the signed per-file hashes against the
   extracted tree, then atomically renames it into place and flips
   `active.json` (pruning keeps {new, previous-good}). A `{"type":"module"}`
   `package.json` marker sits at the staged bundle root (shipped by
   `buildAppBundle`, with a stager safety-net for older bundles) so the ESM
   main loads under the bootstrap's `import()` instead of being parsed as
   CommonJS.
4. **Boot-probe rollback** — the bootstrap writes a breadcrumb
   (`last-attempt.json`) before loading an override. Health is then confirmed
   **from the main process** by polling the renderer DOM: `index.html` ships a
   static `#splash-fallback` that React replaces on mount, so "splash gone +
   `#root` populated" proves a healthy render with no renderer cooperation. The
   renderer's `app.appBooted` IPC heartbeat is kept only as a fast path (it
   proved flaky in packaged builds and used to poison healthy updates). A
   bundle that never renders within 15s is poisoned (`bad.json`) and the app
   relaunches onto the previous-good bundle or the floor; a next-launch check
   (`recoverFromFailedBoot`) covers crashes that beat the probe.
5. **Boot-decision log** — every boot/recover/probe/confirm/load-error decision
   (and *why*: the structured resolve reject reason, e.g. `bad-signature`,
   `file-tampered`) is appended to `<userData>/app/boot-log.json` (rolling 50
   entries) and surfaced via the `app.updateDiagnostics` IPC in the update
   dashboard's Diagnostics panel — a silent fall-back-to-floor is no longer
   invisible.

State files live under `<userData>/app/`: `active.json` (which bundle to load),
`confirmed.json` (last healthy version), `bad.json` (poisoned versions),
`last-attempt.json` (boot breadcrumb), `boot-log.json` (decision log), and one
`<version>/` dir per staged bundle.

### Bundled extensions (OpenAI connections, Computer Use)

The packaged app also carries newer copies of a few extensions in
`plugins-seed` and installs them into `~/.moxxy/plugins` itself, keeping the
previous copy as a backup. An update that needs no approval (the installed copy
is an unchanged managed install) installs before the first runner starts. One
that needs the user's approval — the installed copy has local changes, has no
update record, or is newer than the bundled one — never holds up a runner: the
app starts on the installed copy, the question appears attached to the main
window once it is up, and an approved update installs and restarts the running
conversations onto it. "Later" asks again at the next launch. A failed update
keeps the previous version and says so in a notice attached to the window.
(`DeferredPackageUpdates` in `@moxxy/desktop-host`.) Before, the question was
asked before the first runner and could sit hidden behind the window, leaving
the app on "Waiting for workspace information…".

### Security model

- **Ed25519 signature** over the manifest (public key baked into the bootstrap)
  — the root of trust. The signature covers the version, the compatibility
  gates, `bundleUrl`, the archive `sha256`, and (when present) the per-file
  `files` map — so neither the payload nor the map can be swapped or stripped.
- **SHA-256 of the gzipped download**, bound by the signed manifest — checked
  by the stager before extraction.
- **Signed per-file integrity map** (`files`: bundle-relative path → sha256) —
  verified against the extracted tree at stage time (fail fast, nothing
  activates) **and again by the bootstrap at every load**
  (`resolveActiveBundleDetailed`'s `file-tampered` reject), so an unprivileged
  write under `<userData>/app/` can't pair a tampered file with a genuine
  manifest. **Legacy manifests** (published before the map existed) carry no
  `files` map: they still load, but only their download hash was ever verified
  — their staged tree is NOT re-checked at load time (grandfathered).
- **HTTPS + host allow-list** — only `github.com` / `githubusercontent.com`
  (and subdomains) are ever fetched; the update SOURCE is resolved main-side
  only (the renderer never supplies a URL; the `MOXXY_UPDATE_URL` override is
  honored only in non-packaged runs).
- **Compatibility gate** (`minElectron`, optional `nodeAbi`) — an incompatible
  bundle is treated as a Tier-2 (shell) update, never loaded as JS.
- **Off by default:** with no public key baked in, the app always runs the floor
  and the updater refuses to download. A build can't be tricked into loading an
  unsigned bundle.

## Enabling it (one-time, owner)

Self-update ships **disabled** until you bake a signing key.

### 1. Generate the keypair

```sh
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out moxxy-update.key   # PRIVATE — keep secret
openssl pkey -in moxxy-update.key -pubout                  # PUBLIC — paste below
```

### 2. Bake the public key

Paste the public SPKI PEM (the whole `-----BEGIN/END PUBLIC KEY-----` block) into
`apps/desktop/electron/main/update-key.ts`:

```ts
export const BUNDLED_UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY = `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
`;
```

### 3. Add the private key as a CI secret

In GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions, add **`MOXXY_UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY`** =
the contents of `moxxy-update.key`. The release workflow signs the manifest with
it (and skips the bundle if it's absent — forks/PRs still build).

### 4. Publish the release

A desktop release is cut by merging the changesets **Version Packages** PR that
bumps `@moxxy/desktop`. `release.yml` then builds + signs the bundle (the
"Build + sign app update bundle" step, Linux leg, skipped without the key),
builds the installers from a pinned sha, and — only after **every** installer
build succeeds — pushes the `desktop-v<version>` tag and attaches
`moxxy-app-manifest.json` + `moxxy-app-bundle-<version>.json.gz` (Tier 1) plus
the electron-updater `latest*.yml` + blockmaps (Tier 2) to a **draft** GitHub
Release. Tag-last ordering means a failed build never burns the version.

> **The release must be PUBLISHED, not left as a draft.** Clients discover
> updates by listing the repo's releases via the GitHub API and picking the
> semver-highest **published** `desktop-v*` release — the stager skips drafts
> and prereleases (it does NOT use `releases/latest/...`, which in this
> monorepo usually points at a CLI release). The workflow always creates a
> draft for review; **Publish** it to turn updates on.

For Tier-2 auto-apply on macOS, also complete `docs/desktop-code-signing.md`
(Developer ID signing + notarization). Until then macOS Tier-2 is notify-only.

## Verifying locally

The full build → stage → load round-trip (including a renamed IPC command, to
prove protocol changes ride Tier 1) is covered by the unit/integration tests:

```sh
pnpm --filter @moxxy/desktop-host test app-update
```

To exercise the publisher against a real `dist/`:

```sh
pnpm build   # the script needs @moxxy/desktop-host/dist + apps/desktop/dist*
MOXXY_UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY="$(cat moxxy-update.key)" node scripts/build-app-bundle.mjs
# → apps/desktop/release/update/{moxxy-app-manifest.json, moxxy-app-bundle-<v>.json.gz}
```

A packaged end-to-end check (build vN, install vN+1 via a local manifest, confirm
relaunch picks up the new bundle, corrupt it and confirm rollback) uses the
`MOXXY_UPDATE_URL` dev override (honored only in non-packaged / dev runs).
