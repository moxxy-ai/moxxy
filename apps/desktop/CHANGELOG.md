### Patch Changes

- 95222e1: Fix packaged-app boot crash: bundle `@moxxy/ipc-server-ws` into the main-process output and load it lazily.

  PR #120 added a top-level static import of `@moxxy/ipc-server-ws` to the Electron main but never added the package to `BUNDLED_WORKSPACE_DEPS`, so `externalizeDepsPlugin` left a bare specifier in `dist-electron/main/index.js` that cannot resolve in the packaged app (electron-builder ships only `dist`/`dist-electron`, no node_modules). Every packaged 0.0.33 build — and the Tier-1 hot-update bundle built from the same tree — crashed at main-process load with MODULE_NOT_FOUND, which would also have re-poisoned self-update overrides.

  Two-layer fix: `@moxxy/ipc-server-ws` is now in `BUNDLED_WORKSPACE_DEPS` (with `ws`'s optional native accelerators `bufferutil`/`utf-8-validate` kept external — `ws` falls back to JS implementations), and the bridge is loaded via a guarded dynamic `import()` only when `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE=1` (the shell-updater pattern), so the opt-in bridge can never take down boot again. Verified on a real packaged build: boots clean, and with `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE=1` the bridge listens.

- 0326fb0: Harden the desktop/mobile WebSocket bridge (2026-06-09 audit, wave 5):

  - Reject browser-Origin upgrades unless allow-listed (`allowedOrigins`, default deny; native clients are unaffected).
  - Move the pairing token out of the URL: `Authorization: Bearer` or a `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` bearer entry are the supported presentations; the legacy `?t=` query is opt-in (`allowQueryToken`, kept on only for the mobile channel's already-paired apps). The QR still carries the token, but the app strips it before connecting.
  - Token rotation end to end: `rotateChannelToken` (sdk, persisted with `createdAt` + 90-day staleness warning), `rotateAuthToken` on the live server (drops existing connections), `rotateWsBridgeToken` (desktop) and `MobileChannel.rotateToken`.
  - Backpressure + lifecycle: connection cap (default 8), slow-reader eviction (backlog above 4 MB past a 10s grace terminates the socket), and `close()` now terminates clients so desktop quit doesn't burn its shutdown timeout.
  - `WsRpcClient` no longer replays abandoned requests after reconnect (outbox cleared, queued requests rejected on disconnect) and stops reconnecting after a capped exponential backoff, surfacing a terminal `disconnected` status.
  - Hygiene: empty `MOXXY_WS_PORT` no longer binds an ephemeral port, the server reports the actually-bound port, and the desktop bridge reuses the shared sdk token persistence (userData location kept).

### Patch Changes

- 5fcaaa7: Fix desktop self-update failing to load every override ("Cannot use import
  statement outside a module").

  The hot-update bundle ships only `dist/**` + `dist-electron/**`, so a staged
  bundle under `<userData>/app/<version>/` had **no `package.json` above its
  main**. The real main (`dist-electron/main/index.js`) is emitted as an ES module
  (`import` syntax), and Electron's bundled Node (v20, no ESM syntax
  auto-detection) decides ESM-vs-CJS from the nearest `package.json#type` — with
  none reachable it defaults to CommonJS and the bootstrap's `import()` threw
  `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. Every staged version
  (0.0.28/29/31/32) loaded this way got poisoned and the app silently reverted to
  the baked floor. The floor itself loads fine only because the packaged `.app`
  carries the desktop `package.json` (`"type":"module"`).

  `buildAppBundle` now ships a minimal `{"type":"module"}` `package.json` at the
  bundle root (signed into the bundle), and the stager writes the same marker at
  extract time when a bundle lacks one — so already-published bundles are also
  rescued on re-stage. The single marker is sourced from one constant shared by
  the producer and the stager so they can't drift.

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- c421ab5: Desktop: make Clerk sign-in work in the packaged app, and add a `moxxy://`
  deep-link.

  Sign-in failed in the packaged build with `prohibited_redirect_url`: the
  renderer was served from `file://`, so clerk-js derived a `file://` OAuth
  redirect, which Clerk rejects (only `http(s)` schemes are allowed). It worked
  in dev only because Vite serves `http://localhost`.

  The packaged renderer is now served from a hardened in-process loopback HTTP
  server (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, 127.0.0.1-only, fixed port list, GET/HEAD
  only, path-traversal + Host-header guards, SPA fallback). A loopback origin is
  a Chromium _secure context_ and an allowed OAuth redirect scheme, so the
  existing `clerk.openSignIn()` modal + OAuth popup work as they do on the web.
  The CSP gate now matches the loopback origin (directives unchanged — clerk-js
  still loads from the instance's Frontend API host), the focus widget loads from
  the same origin, and OAuth popups get a clean desktop-Chrome user-agent (no
  Electron/app tokens) to avoid Google's embedded-webview block. If every
  loopback port is taken, it falls back to `file://` (the window still renders).

  Also adds a `moxxy://` custom-protocol deep-link as general-purpose transport
  (single-instance lock + protocol registration + `open-url`/`second-instance`
  capture → a typed `deepLink:received` IPC event, with cold-start links buffered
  and drained via `deepLink:drain` on mount). Nothing routes on it yet — it's the
  plumbing for notification + action links.

  Owner action: add the loopback origins (`http://127.0.0.1` and
  `http://localhost` on the configured ports) to the Clerk dashboard's allowed
  origins / redirect URLs for the production instance.

## 0.0.31

### Patch Changes

- 4c997f6: Fix desktop self-update never sticking ("downloads but stays on the old version").

  The boot-probe required the renderer's `app.appBooted` IPC heartbeat to land within
  15s to mark a hot-updated bundle healthy; in packaged builds that heartbeat doesn't
  reliably land, so the probe poisoned **every** healthy update and reverted to the
  floor (confirmed from on-disk state: `bad.json` had poisoned every staged version and
  `confirmed.json` never existed). The probe now confirms a healthy render from the
  **main process** by inspecting the renderer DOM — `index.html` ships a static
  `#splash-fallback` inside `#root` that React replaces on mount, so its absence is a
  renderer-cooperation-free health signal. The IPC heartbeat is kept only as a fast
  path; a genuine white-screen (never renders) is still poisoned and reverted.

## 0.0.30

### Patch Changes

- fab0fb4: Update flows: a real `moxxy update`, a TUI "new version" nudge, and observable desktop self-update.

  - **CLI** — new `moxxy update` command: checks the npm registry, detects how the
    CLI was installed (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun, global or local), and runs the matching
    upgrade after a confirm. `--check`/`--dry-run` report-only, `--yes` to skip the
    prompt. Source checkouts get git advice instead of an install.
  - **TUI** — surfaces a newer published `@moxxy/cli` as a one-line, auto-dismissing
    banner and shows the running version in the status line. The check is cached
    (~12h) and fully non-blocking on startup. (Also fixes the `version` prop being
    dropped before it reached the view.)
  - **Desktop self-update** — the previously-silent fall-back-to-the-floor is now
    observable: a persistent boot-decision log under `<userData>/app/boot-log.json`,
    a reason for every gate that rejects a staged bundle, and a Settings → Dashboard
    → Diagnostics readout. The renderer's boot confirmation is hardened (retry +
    reported failure) so a flaky heartbeat can't make the boot-probe revert a
    healthy update. Adds the `app.updateDiagnostics` / `app.bootHeartbeatFailed` IPC.

## 0.0.29

### Patch Changes

- e9ef74d: Desktop: fix sign-in doing nothing with a production (`pk_live_`) Clerk key.

  The packaged app's CSP and OAuth-popup allow-list only permitted Clerk's
  dev/test hosts (`*.clerk.accounts.dev` / `*.clerk.com`). A production
  publishable key serves clerk-js from the instance's OWN Frontend API domain
  (encoded in the key, e.g. `clerk.<your-domain>`), so the script was
  CSP-blocked, clerk-js never initialised, and `clerk.openSignIn()` silently
  rendered no modal.

  The Frontend API host is now decoded from the publishable key and folded into
  the CSP (`script-src`/`connect-src`/`frame-src`/`img-src`) plus the OAuth popup
  allow-list. The key is baked into the main bundle via electron-vite `define`
  (the renderer already read it via `import.meta.env`). Test keys are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- cc62060: Stop the desktop chat-log from growing without bound on every restart. The runner
  replays a conversation's full event history to the renderer on each attach, and the
  renderer re-appended every replayed event to its NDJSON mirror
  (`~/.moxxy/chats/<workspace>.jsonl`), so the file grew by a complete copy of the
  conversation per restart — which also shifted `loadSegment`'s line-index cursors and
  corrupted scroll-up pagination. `appendEvents` is now idempotent by event id, so the
  log keeps exactly one copy and its pagination cursors stay stable.

### Patch Changes

- a2d551f: Desktop: resume a workspace's conversation + model context across app
  restarts, and make `/new` actually start a fresh session.

  The desktop owns and kills its `moxxy serve` child on quit, and each launch
  spawned a bare `serve` that minted a brand-new empty session — so the model
  forgot the whole conversation and the transcript collapsed to just the
  post-restart message (the TUI didn't have this because its long-lived daemon
  survives a window close). Now each per-workspace runner is given a sticky
  session id (its desk id) so it resumes `~/.moxxy/sessions/<id>.jsonl` if present
  and starts fresh under that id on first run.

  - New `SetupOptions.sessionId` / `BuildSessionArgs.sessionId`: "resume-if-present"
    (distinct from `resumeSessionId`, which errors when the log is missing — for
    an explicit `moxxy resume <id>`).
  - `serve` reads `MOXXY_SESSION_ID`; the desktop `RunnerSupervisor`/`RunnerPool`
    pass the workspace's desk id through to it.
  - Renderer: the runner replays its FULL history on every attach (and re-attach
    after a reconnect), so the chat runtime now de-dupes ingested events by id
    (`seenIds`, kept in lockstep across live append, replay, and pagination). This
    makes a resumed replay idempotent and also fixes a latent bug where a transient
    reconnect to a still-alive runner could duplicate the transcript.
  - `/new` now works on its own (previously it did nothing in the desktop — only
    `/clear` was handled). It clears the transcript AND resets the runner via a
    new `session.newSession` IPC → `RunnerSupervisor.resetSession()`, which wipes
    the persisted session log and restarts so the model context truly resets and
    doesn't resurrect on the next launch.

### Patch Changes

- f75a85f: Fix self-update never taking effect: the immutable bootstrap read
  `app.getPath('userData')` before `app.setName('MoxxyAI Workspaces')` ran (that
  call lives in the later-loaded `index.js`). In a packaged build Electron derives
  `getName()` from the package `name` (`@moxxy/desktop`), not electron-builder's
  `productName`, so the loader looked for staged updates under a different userData
  directory than the one the updater writes to — making every downloaded update
  invisible and silently booting the baked floor instead. The bootstrap now sets
  the app name before resolving `userData`, so it and the updater agree. (Takes
  effect after one fresh installer; subsequent hot-updates then apply.)

## 0.0.19

### Patch Changes

- a2087c0: Desktop: redesign sign-in, loading, focus mode, and onboarding; add one-click Node install.

  - **Sign-in** now opens Clerk's own modal from the sidebar profile pill — the
    dedicated onboarding "Sign in" step and the heavily-customized embedded
    `<SignIn>` are gone. The pill shows only **Sign in** or your profile (no more
    "Guest" state).
  - **Loading screen:** the connecting screen is now a friendly, branded surface
    on the app's near-white background (continuous with the splash and chat) — no
    more greyish "Starting moxxy serve…" with socket/pid rows. Failures show a
    short message + Retry with the diagnostics tucked behind a "Technical details"
    disclosure.
  - **Focus widget:** the mini-text panel is drag-resizable, renders the full
    latest message as scrollable Markdown, and stopping a voice recording now
    opens the panel to show the transcript + streaming answer.
  - **Onboarding:** refreshed two-column look (near-white pane, lighter step rail)
    plus a one-click **"Install automatically"** button that downloads the
    official Node LTS into the app's data dir — no admin or package manager — with
    the manual nodejs.org download as a fallback.
  - Swapped the moxxy loader/avatar animation.

## 0.0.18

### Patch Changes

- f7c236a: fix(desktop): a hot-update that failed to boot once could never be installed
  again. The bootstrap poisons a bundle version (adds it to `bad.json`) when its
  renderer doesn't confirm a healthy mount in time, but nothing ever cleared that
  mark — so every later "download + restart" re-staged the same version,
  `resolveActiveBundle` rejected it as poisoned, and the app silently fell back to
  the packaged floor ("downloads, but restart still shows the old version").
  `downloadAndStage` now clears the poison mark for the version it installs, since
  an explicit user (re)install is a deliberate retry; the boot-probe still
  re-poisons a genuinely broken bundle, so this only ever grants one fresh attempt.

## 0.0.17

### Patch Changes

- 0dad297: chore(ci): collapse the release pipeline into one changeset-driven workflow.
  The desktop installers now build + ship as gated jobs inside `release.yml`
  (folding in `release-desktop.yml`), removing the auto-PR machine and the
  cross-workflow dispatch. `@moxxy/cli` is now a declared desktop dependency, so a
  CLI/SDK release cascades a patch bump and cuts a desktop release automatically.
  A `Changeset present` CI job now fails any PR that lacks a changeset (use
  `pnpm changeset --empty` for no-release changes).

## 0.0.6

### Minor Changes

- Self-update: the desktop now hot-updates its JS layers (renderer + main + preload + IPC contract) as one Ed25519-signed app bundle, activated by an immutable bootstrap loader — no reinstall. Rare native/Electron bumps fall back to electron-updater (Tier 2). Signature + SHA-256 + host-pin verified in the immutable floor; a boot-probe reverts a bundle that fails to render. See `docs/desktop-self-update.md`.

- 6dea644: Fix tool calls getting stuck "running" forever (flipping to error only on the next message). When the stuck-loop detector tripped, `mode-tool-use` (the default mode) and `mode-goal` ended the turn after emitting `tool_call_requested` but before running the call — orphaning it with no `tool_result`. The turn still completed (re-enabling the composer), so the orphaned call spun indefinitely until the next `user_prompt` swept it into an error. Both modes now synthesize a failed result for every already-emitted request before bailing, matching the abort path and the already-correct plan-execute/developer modes. This also stops the provider from rejecting the unresolved tool-use block on the following turn.
