## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- cf2f651: Audit wave: documentation drift + dead-code cleanup.

  - Removed dead exports: `@moxxy/core`'s unused `selectPendingToolCalls` / `selectCurrentTurn`
    event selectors and `@moxxy/sdk`'s unused voice helpers (`checkTranscriberReady`,
    `resolveTranscriber`, `pickFirstAvailableTranscriber`) — zero importers across the repo.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-telegram` no longer declares `zod` as a dependency (it never imported it).
  - CLI `--help` ENV section now lists the user-facing `MOXXY_*` variables and points at the
    new full table in the README.
  - Docs-only (no release impact): AGENTS.md/README.md architecture lists reconciled against
    the actual package set (mode-default replaces the deleted mode-tool-use; PR #120 client
    layer + channel-web/view/mobile + apps/mobile added), the published `@moxxy/sdk` README
    examples rewritten against the real API, apps/docs corrections (tools-builtin reality,
    testing API, four providers, full package index), and the dead `lint` task removed from
    turbo.json.

- cf2f651: Security: four audit leftovers (A43–A46). MCP server credentials now support `${vault:NAME}` placeholders in env/header values, resolved only at connect time (the persisted mcp.json and the model-visible tool args keep the placeholder; `mcp_add_server`/`mcp_test_server` instruct vault-first). Agent-view URLs are scheme-allow-listed (`https`/`http`/`mailto`/`tel` + relative; `data:image/*` for img src only) at BOTH walls: a canonical `isSafeViewUrl` in the sdk enforced by `parseView` and `validateDoc`, and a render-time re-check in the web frontend that neutralizes `javascript:`/`data:text` hrefs and srcs. `web_fetch` closes its DNS-rebinding TOCTOU by pinning every hop's connection to the SSRF-guard-vetted addresses via an undici dispatcher with a fixed lookup (SNI/cert validation intact). Telegram inline-keyboard callbacks now enforce the same pairing authorization gate as text/voice messages.

### Patch Changes

- 0326fb0: Event-log and session-persistence hardening (audit wave 5):

  - `EventLog.ingest` no longer leaks async listener rejections as unhandled rejections — they are swallowed under the same non-fatal policy as `append()`.
  - Session event-log write failures are no longer silent: one structured warning per failure streak (path + error), a `SessionPersistence.degraded` flag, and a recovery log once writes succeed again.
  - `restoreEvents` re-sequences restored events to contiguous seq 0..n-1 around corrupt JSONL lines (warning with skip/re-sequence counts) and atomically repairs the on-disk file, so a single corrupt middle line no longer truncates attached-client replay or causes seq collisions on new appends.
  - `projectMessages` skips empty/whitespace-only assistant text blocks (keeping tool_use blocks), so tool-only turns — including historical wedged logs — no longer produce empty text blocks that providers reject.

- 2e4bc37: Goal-mode auto-approve now respects user permission policy (audit A3). `PermissionResolver` gains an optional prompt-free `policyCheck(call, ctx)` (implemented by core's policy wrapper) that returns the engine/tool-rule decision without ever falling through to an interactive prompt. Goal mode consults it before auto-allowing, so `~/.moxxy/permissions.json` deny rules now deny in unattended runs — previously the auto-approve resolver replaced the whole policy chain, silently ignoring them.
- f3c798f: `/new` now truly resets the session everywhere (audit A10). New `session.reset` runner RPC (protocol v3) + optional `SessionLike.reset()` capability: the runner aborts in-flight turns and clears its authoritative event log; the log's new `EventLog.onClear` listeners broadcast a `session.reset` notification so every attached mirror clears in lockstep (re-arming seq-0 ingest instead of silently rejecting all further events) and truncate the persisted session JSONL so wiped history can't resurrect on `--resume` — fixing the same resurrection bug for local `/new`. The TUI and Telegram `/new` paths call `reset()` (falling back to `log.clear()` when the capability is absent) and report an error instead of claiming "history cleared" when the reset RPC fails.
