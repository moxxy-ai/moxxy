 * the welding out: a {@link CommandBus} registers request handlers and an
 * {@link EventSink} broadcasts events — and *what* sits behind them (Electron
 * IPC, or a WebSocket serving the same contract to a mobile client) is a
 * swappable detail. The per-domain handler bodies register against a
 * `CommandBus` and never see the transport.
 *
 * The matching client primitive is {@link MoxxyApi} (`invoke` / `subscribe`)
 * already declared in `./index`. A bus is its server-side mirror.
