### Patch Changes

- 4a8ec5d: Workflows round-2 correctness: gate the unshippable `awaitInput` resume, make the visual builder work on the desktop, and fix loop/validation correctness.

  **`awaitInput` is gated (was a hang-forever dead-end).** The executor can pause + checkpoint an `awaitInput` step, but the resume trigger/channel that delivers the operator's reply never shipped to `main` — `resumeWorkflowRun` had zero production callers. So an agent-drafted "ask me, then act" workflow would pause forever, leak a retained child session for the process lifetime, and orphan a checkpoint file. `awaitInput` is now **rejected at validate/save time** with a clear "requires the resume channel, not available in this build" message, and `draft.ts` no longer teaches it (it steers the author to `inputs` fields instead). Defense-in-depth: the CLI runner treats a `paused` result as non-terminal (no inbox delivery), `Session.close()` clears retained child sessions so they can't leak, and a `WorkflowRunStore.sweepStale()` sweeper (7-day TTL, run on workflows boot) reaps orphaned `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` checkpoints. The executor pause/resume path is kept intact so re-enabling is a matter of landing a resume trigger and removing the schema gate.

  **Visual builder works on the desktop now.** The desktop drives a `RemoteSession`, whose workflows view only forwarded `list`/`setEnabled`/`run` — so the builder's `validateDraft`/`save`/`getRun` were `undefined` and threw "not supported on this session". Added a `workflow.validateDraft|save|getRun` runner-RPC family (**protocol bumped to v4**) with RemoteSession client methods + server handlers, so the desktop builder validates/saves/loads against the runner.

  **Loop + validation correctness.** A condition/switch step used as a loop body is rejected (its branch routing was silently ignored). A non-loop-body step that `needs` a loop-body step is rejected (it would stall — body steps are excluded from the main DAG). A loop-body step's own `when` guard and any `needs` other than its loop step / a sibling body step are rejected (body steps run unconditionally each iteration). Logic-step `vars` now drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prototype-pollution guard). Paused-run checkpoints persist + restore `vars` set before the pause. Renaming a workflow via the builder removes the old file/entry instead of leaving an orphaned duplicate (`save(workflow, previousName)`, threaded through the view → IPC → runner RPC → builder hook).

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 0326fb0: Harden the runner socket: the socket's parent directory is created/tightened to 0700 before listen (closing the chmod-after-listen window where another local user could connect), socket chmod failures are logged loudly instead of swallowed, and turn aborts are ownership-tracked — a cross-client abort is still allowed (shared-session model) but leaves an audit log naming both connection roles, with `MOXXY_RUNNER_STRICT_ABORT=1` opting into denial. On Windows the named pipe keeps the default DACL (Everyone gets read-only, no write); a one-time warning documents that gap.
- f3c798f: `/new` now truly resets the session everywhere (audit A10). New `session.reset` runner RPC (protocol v3) + optional `SessionLike.reset()` capability: the runner aborts in-flight turns and clears its authoritative event log; the log's new `EventLog.onClear` listeners broadcast a `session.reset` notification so every attached mirror clears in lockstep (re-arming seq-0 ingest instead of silently rejecting all further events) and truncate the persisted session JSONL so wiped history can't resurrect on `--resume` — fixing the same resurrection bug for local `/new`. The TUI and Telegram `/new` paths call `reset()` (falling back to `log.clear()` when the capability is absent) and report an error instead of claiming "history cleared" when the reset RPC fails.

### Patch Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.
