### Minor Changes

- 1e4ed09: chore(debt): unify tunnel spawning, finish MoxxyError adoption, retire stale casts

  Round-3 tech-debt drawdown:

  - **Tunnel unification (P2 #4).** New `spawnCliTunnel` + `isCliTunnelAvailable` exports on
    `@moxxy/sdk` own the spawn → parse-URL → resolve/reject lifecycle and no-orphan child
    cleanup for CLI tunnels. cloudflared/ngrok (channel-web) are now thin configs over it,
    and the webhooks plugin consumes registered `TunnelProviderDef`s instead of its own
    `startTunnel` (same URLs parsed, same teardown/pid/stop surface). channel-web's
    `child-cleanup.ts` is removed (folded into the SDK helper).
  - **MoxxyError adoption (P2 #5).** User-facing throws migrated to typed `MoxxyError`:
    oauth_authorize missing deviceUrl/authUrl (`TOOL_ERROR`), vault placeholder missing entry
    (`CONFIG_INVALID`), vault_get not-found (`TOOL_ERROR`), unsupported vault file
    (`VAULT_CORRUPT`). Internal invariant throws stay plain `Error`.
  - **Casts / hardcoded values (P3 #8).** Removed the `as unknown` exec-allowlist cast in
    plugin-security (CapabilitySpec.commands is now typed), tightened the Anthropic provider's
    `requestBody`/`countTokens` casts to the SDK's real param types (narrow, commented casts
    only where the SDK literal-narrows `media_type`), and corrected stale hardcoded model
    context windows (opus-4-7 / sonnet-4-6 are 1M, not 800k/200k) + maxOutputTokens.
  - **RemoteSession seam casts (P1 #1).** Dropped the redundant `as unknown as SessionLike`
    and command-handler casts in `desktop-host` (RemoteSession implements ClientSession →
    SessionLike; CommandContext.session is `unknown`).

### Patch Changes

- 4a8ec5d: Workflows round-2 correctness: gate the unshippable `awaitInput` resume, make the visual builder work on the desktop, and fix loop/validation correctness.

  **`awaitInput` is gated (was a hang-forever dead-end).** The executor can pause + checkpoint an `awaitInput` step, but the resume trigger/channel that delivers the operator's reply never shipped to `main` — `resumeWorkflowRun` had zero production callers. So an agent-drafted "ask me, then act" workflow would pause forever, leak a retained child session for the process lifetime, and orphan a checkpoint file. `awaitInput` is now **rejected at validate/save time** with a clear "requires the resume channel, not available in this build" message, and `draft.ts` no longer teaches it (it steers the author to `inputs` fields instead). Defense-in-depth: the CLI runner treats a `paused` result as non-terminal (no inbox delivery), `Session.close()` clears retained child sessions so they can't leak, and a `WorkflowRunStore.sweepStale()` sweeper (7-day TTL, run on workflows boot) reaps orphaned `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` checkpoints. The executor pause/resume path is kept intact so re-enabling is a matter of landing a resume trigger and removing the schema gate.

  **Visual builder works on the desktop now.** The desktop drives a `RemoteSession`, whose workflows view only forwarded `list`/`setEnabled`/`run` — so the builder's `validateDraft`/`save`/`getRun` were `undefined` and threw "not supported on this session". Added a `workflow.validateDraft|save|getRun` runner-RPC family (**protocol bumped to v4**) with RemoteSession client methods + server handlers, so the desktop builder validates/saves/loads against the runner.

  **Loop + validation correctness.** A condition/switch step used as a loop body is rejected (its branch routing was silently ignored). A non-loop-body step that `needs` a loop-body step is rejected (it would stall — body steps are excluded from the main DAG). A loop-body step's own `when` guard and any `needs` other than its loop step / a sibling body step are rejected (body steps run unconditionally each iteration). Logic-step `vars` now drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prototype-pollution guard). Paused-run checkpoints persist + restore `vars` set before the pause. Renaming a workflow via the builder removes the old file/entry instead of leaving an orphaned duplicate (`save(workflow, previousName)`, threaded through the view → IPC → runner RPC → builder hook).

- 6afc4c0: Workflows engine (phase 1 of 2): port the logic-step + agentic-authoring engine onto current main, and add a bounded while-loop node.

  **Engine features ported.** `@moxxy/plugin-workflows` now supports logic steps — `bridge` (extract/transform upstream output into `vars`), `condition` (if/else gate routed by an LLM `{"branch":"then"|"else"}`), and `switch` (multi-way gate routed by case id) — plus a `format: json|plain` field, branch fields (`then`/`else`/`cases`/`default`), a persisted-only `ui.layout` schema (node x/y + viewport, no editor here), agentic YAML authoring (`draft.ts` `buildSystemPrompt`/`draftWorkflow` + the `workflow_create` tool teaching the full schema), LLM branch-predicate parsing (`logic-response.ts`), and `awaitInput` pause/resume for prompt/skill steps (`run-store.ts` checkpoints under `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` + executor `resumeWorkflowRun`). The DAG executor (`executor/dag.ts`) gains `runLogicStep`, `mergeVars`, `applyBranchSkips`, and an `ExecutorContext`, merged surgically onto main's baseline — main's `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` guard and behavior are preserved, as is the CLI's separate inter-workflow `afterWorkflow` cycle guard (`MAX_AFTER_WORKFLOW_CHAIN`, Tarjan SCC). The SDK gains the matching types (`WorkflowLoopAction`, `WorkflowLogicStepFormat`, `WorkflowRunStatus`, `WorkflowUi*`, `awaitInput`, `retainSession`, `SubagentContinueArgs`); core's subagent runtime gains retained-session `continue()`/`release()` (new `run-child.ts` + `registry.ts`) backing the pause/resume flow.

  **New `loop` node.** A `loop: { body: string[], condition: string, maxIterations: 1..50 (default 10) }` action repeats its body steps in order each iteration (resetting their state per pass, honoring `onError`), then evaluates `condition` via the same LLM predicate as a `condition` step. `condition` is the loop's EXIT/GOAL condition — the body repeats UNTIL it is met: `then` = condition met → STOP (continue to the next step), `else` = not yet met → run another iteration. A body step error BREAKS the loop to the next step (the loop returns ok with a "broke on error" note rather than failing the whole workflow), unless that body step sets `onError: continue` (which swallows the error and keeps iterating). It is unmistakably safe: it terminates when the exit condition is met, when a body error breaks it, OR at `maxIterations` (finishing with a clear note, never hanging), and composes with `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` (a body that calls nested workflows still bottoms out at the depth cap). The iteration cap and the depth cap are independent guards; neither can be defeated by the other. Schema rejects loops combined with `then`/`else`/`cases`/`default`, empty bodies, out-of-range `maxIterations`, unresolvable body ids, and `awaitInput` on a loop.

  **IPC for the upcoming visual builder (phase 2).** Additive, capability-detectable commands `workflows.validateDraft` (parse YAML → errors), `workflows.save` (persist a workflow), and `workflows.getRun` (fetch canonical YAML): zod-validated contract + a desktop-host pass-through handler + new optional `WorkflowsView` methods, with the mobile `MobileSessionHost` extended to parity. The visual builder GUI itself is phase 2 (follow-up).

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- cf2f651: Audit wave: documentation drift + dead-code cleanup.

  - Removed dead exports: `@moxxy/core`'s unused `selectPendingToolCalls` / `selectCurrentTurn`
    event selectors and `@moxxy/sdk`'s unused voice helpers (`checkTranscriberReady`,
    `resolveTranscriber`, `pickFirstAvailableTranscriber`) — zero importers across the repo.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-telegram` no longer declares `zod` as a dependency (it never imported it).
  - CLI `--help` ENV section now lists the user-facing `MOXXY_*` variables and points at the
    new full table in the README.
  - Docs-only (no release impact): AGENTS.md/README.md architecture lists reconciled against
    the actual package set (mode-default replaces the deleted mode-tool-use; PR #120 client
    layer + channel-web/view/mobile + apps/mobile added), the published `@moxxy/sdk` README
    examples rewritten against the real API, apps/docs corrections (tools-builtin reality,
    testing API, four providers, full package index), and the dead `lint` task removed from
    turbo.json.

- cf2f651: Performance pack from the 2026-06-09 audit (A39–A42 + A42b): the TUI context meter caches its token estimate per log and folds in only new events instead of re-walking the entire event log (incl. JSON.stringify of every tool result) on every ~30Hz render; the desktop NDJSON chat log keeps a size/mtime-guarded line-offset index so scroll-up pages seek-read only their own byte range instead of re-reading and re-parsing the whole file per page; MemoryStore maintains its MEMORY.md index incrementally (no more O(N) re-read of every memory file per write) and gains a warn-only `maxMemories` soft cap (default 500 — no eviction, memories are user knowledge); goal mode declares its idle nudge as a volatile tail message and the stable-prefix cache strategy places its rolling tail breakpoint before volatile messages, so idle goal iterations re-read the cached prefix instead of paying a guaranteed-wasted cache write; and compactor-summarize now produces a real summary via the session's own provider/model (new optional `provider`/`model` on `CompactContext`), falls back to an honest, clearly-labeled head+tail digest when no provider is reachable, and reports `tokensSaved` from real character deltas instead of the fabricated `slice.length * 30`.
- cf2f651: Provider-parity fixes from the 2026-06-09 audit (A36–A38):

  - **Codex (A36):** `req.maxTokens` now reaches the Responses API as `max_output_tokens`; `req.temperature` is documented-unsupported on the Codex backend (gpt-5 reasoning models reject sampling params) and dropped with a one-shot MOXXY_DEBUG note instead of silently; `reasoningEffort` is a live `CodexProviderConfig` option (was pinned to 'medium') and the CLI's codex credential resolver now passes `provider.config` through to the client instead of discarding it.
  - **Runtime openai-compat providers (A37):** registered vendors now report their own name + model catalog on the live client (usage stats / errors / context-window lookups no longer misattributed to 'openai'); vault/env key naming is unified behind `providerApiKeyName`/`storedProviderApiKeyName` in plugin-provider-admin — the CLI honors a stored `envVar` override and maps hyphens to underscores, matching the desktop; `provider_add` model descriptors can declare `supportsDocuments` so attachments stop degrading.
  - **`req.system` contract (A38):** hook-injected system text (e.g. plugin-memory's consolidation nudge) now actually reaches every provider — delivered in addition to system-role messages (anthropic: extra system block after the cache breakpoint; openai: inserted system message; codex: appended to `instructions`). The loop helpers no longer prefill `req.system` with the system prompt, which also removes a duplicated base prompt in codex `instructions`.

- cf2f651: Security: four audit leftovers (A43–A46). MCP server credentials now support `${vault:NAME}` placeholders in env/header values, resolved only at connect time (the persisted mcp.json and the model-visible tool args keep the placeholder; `mcp_add_server`/`mcp_test_server` instruct vault-first). Agent-view URLs are scheme-allow-listed (`https`/`http`/`mailto`/`tel` + relative; `data:image/*` for img src only) at BOTH walls: a canonical `isSafeViewUrl` in the sdk enforced by `parseView` and `validateDoc`, and a render-time re-check in the web frontend that neutralizes `javascript:`/`data:text` hrefs and srcs. `web_fetch` closes its DNS-rebinding TOCTOU by pinning every hop's connection to the SSRF-guard-vetted addresses via an undici dispatcher with a fixed lookup (SNI/cert validation intact). Telegram inline-keyboard callbacks now enforce the same pairing authorization gate as text/voice messages.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e4bc37: Goal-mode auto-approve now respects user permission policy (audit A3). `PermissionResolver` gains an optional prompt-free `policyCheck(call, ctx)` (implemented by core's policy wrapper) that returns the engine/tool-rule decision without ever falling through to an interactive prompt. Goal mode consults it before auto-allowing, so `~/.moxxy/permissions.json` deny rules now deny in unattended runs — previously the auto-approve resolver replaced the whole policy chain, silently ignoring them.

### Patch Changes

- 0326fb0: Event-log and session-persistence hardening (audit wave 5):

  - `EventLog.ingest` no longer leaks async listener rejections as unhandled rejections — they are swallowed under the same non-fatal policy as `append()`.
  - Session event-log write failures are no longer silent: one structured warning per failure streak (path + error), a `SessionPersistence.degraded` flag, and a recovery log once writes succeed again.
  - `restoreEvents` re-sequences restored events to contiguous seq 0..n-1 around corrupt JSONL lines (warning with skip/re-sequence counts) and atomically repairs the on-disk file, so a single corrupt middle line no longer truncates attached-client replay or causes seq collisions on new appends.
  - `projectMessages` skips empty/whitespace-only assistant text blocks (keeping tool_use blocks), so tool-only turns — including historical wedged logs — no longer produce empty text blocks that providers reject.

- f3c798f: `/new` now truly resets the session everywhere (audit A10). New `session.reset` runner RPC (protocol v3) + optional `SessionLike.reset()` capability: the runner aborts in-flight turns and clears its authoritative event log; the log's new `EventLog.onClear` listeners broadcast a `session.reset` notification so every attached mirror clears in lockstep (re-arming seq-0 ingest instead of silently rejecting all further events) and truncate the persisted session JSONL so wiped history can't resurrect on `--resume` — fixing the same resurrection bug for local `/new`. The TUI and Telegram `/new` paths call `reset()` (falling back to `log.clear()` when the capability is absent) and report an error instead of claiming "history cleared" when the reset RPC fails.
- 0326fb0: Harden the desktop/mobile WebSocket bridge (2026-06-09 audit, wave 5):

  - Reject browser-Origin upgrades unless allow-listed (`allowedOrigins`, default deny; native clients are unaffected).
  - Move the pairing token out of the URL: `Authorization: Bearer` or a `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` bearer entry are the supported presentations; the legacy `?t=` query is opt-in (`allowQueryToken`, kept on only for the mobile channel's already-paired apps). The QR still carries the token, but the app strips it before connecting.
  - Token rotation end to end: `rotateChannelToken` (sdk, persisted with `createdAt` + 90-day staleness warning), `rotateAuthToken` on the live server (drops existing connections), `rotateWsBridgeToken` (desktop) and `MobileChannel.rotateToken`.
  - Backpressure + lifecycle: connection cap (default 8), slow-reader eviction (backlog above 4 MB past a 10s grace terminates the socket), and `close()` now terminates clients so desktop quit doesn't burn its shutdown timeout.
  - `WsRpcClient` no longer replays abandoned requests after reconnect (outbox cleared, queued requests rejected on disconnect) and stops reconnecting after a capped exponential backoff, surfacing a terminal `disconnected` status.
  - Hygiene: empty `MOXXY_WS_PORT` no longer binds an ephemeral port, the server reports the actually-bound port, and the desktop bridge reuses the shared sdk token persistence (userData location kept).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- eac83e5: Hoist the duplicated tool-batch loop scaffolding out of `mode-default` and `mode-goal`
  into shared SDK helpers, so the load-bearing stuck-loop orphan-result fix lives in one
  place instead of being hand-mirrored across modes. `@moxxy/sdk` now exports
  `executeToolUses` (run a tool batch, synthesizing failed results + an abort on
  mid-batch cancel) and `emitRequestsAndDetectStuck` (emit `tool_call_requested`s, run the
  stuck detector, and on a trip synthesize a paired `tool_result` for every emitted call
  before the fatal error), parameterized by a `StuckLoopReport` for each mode's wording and
  goal mode's extra `goal_stuck` event. Pure refactor — no behavior change.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- b928391: Fix auto-compaction and auto-elision silently disabling on unrecognised model
  ids — the agent could grow its context unbounded and lose earlier context.

  `runCompactionIfNeeded` and `runElisionIfNeeded` resolved the model's context
  window via an exact `provider.models.find(m => m.id === ctx.model)` and bailed
  to a permanent no-op when it missed. But `config.model` is a free-form string
  and providers serve ids that aren't in their fixed descriptor list (a newer
  release like `claude-opus-4-8`, a dated id, or a runtime provider-admin model),
  so any such id turned BOTH context-management features off for the whole
  session. A shared `resolveModelContext` now falls back to the provider's first
  descriptor — exactly what the TUI context meter already did — so compaction and
  elision stay active on unlisted ids. The reactive overflow recovery
  (`runCompactionIfNeeded(ctx, { force: true })`) also now runs even when no
  window can be resolved at all, so an over-context turn compacts-and-retries
  instead of dying.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ad26425: Add a `claude-code` provider so Claude Pro/Max subscribers can use moxxy with
  their subscription instead of a pay-as-you-go API key.

  - New `@moxxy/plugin-provider-claude-code`: talks to the standard Anthropic
    Messages API with a Claude Code OAuth bearer token (`anthropic-beta:
oauth-2025-04-20` + the required "You are Claude Code…" system preamble).
  - Two ways to authenticate: paste a token from `claude setup-token` (or set
    `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), or run `moxxy login claude-code` for an
    interactive out-of-band OAuth sign-in. Access tokens refresh automatically.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-provider-anthropic`: `AnthropicProvider` gained an OAuth mode
    (bearer auth + system preamble + refresh-on-401); the API-key path is
    unchanged.
  - `@moxxy/sdk`: `ProviderAuthContext` gained an optional `prompt()` so auth
    flows can ask the user to paste a code/token (used by the out-of-band flow).

- e64aa0e: Fix "Mode not registered: tool-use" after the mode rename. A mode name persisted
  anywhere (config `mode:`, `~/.moxxy/preferences.json`, a desktop workspace's
  stored mode, a runner `setMode` RPC, a mid-turn mode hand-off) is now funneled
  through a legacy-name map in `ModeRegistry.setActive`: it tries the literal name
  first and falls back to the current name (`tool-use`→`default`,
  `deep-research`→`research`; the removed `plan-execute`/`bmad`/`developer` →
  `default`). A validly-registered name is never overridden, and a genuinely
  unknown mode still throws. Exposes `migrateModeName(name)` from `@moxxy/sdk`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b014c3a: Slim the loop modes to three and turn plugin management into a first-class,
  plug/unplug system.

  Modes: the registry now ships only `default` (the Claude Code-style ReAct loop,
  package renamed `@moxxy/mode-tool-use` → `@moxxy/mode-default`, export
  `toolUseModePlugin` → `defaultModePlugin`), `goal` (autonomous auto-approve
  loop), and `research` (mode-name renamed from `deep-research`). The `bmad`,
  `developer`, and `plan-execute` modes are removed. Persisted preferences with
  the old mode names (`tool-use`, `deep-research`) are migrated on read, so
  existing sessions keep working.

  Plugins: the standalone "marketplace" is gone — install/remove/enable/disable
  and the installable-plugin catalog now live in `@moxxy/plugin-plugins-admin`.
  The `moxxy plugins` CLI gains `search`, `install`, `remove`, `enable`,
  `disable`, and `open` subcommands (alongside `list`/`reload`/`new`), and the TUI
  gains a `/plugins` picker (tabbed by plugin kind) to plug/unplug plugins live.
  The model can manage plugins on request via new `search_plugins` (npm registry +
  catalog discovery), `enable_plugin`, and `disable_plugin` tools, plus the
  existing `install_plugin` / `uninstall_plugin` — so "find me a plugin for X and
  install it" / "disable plugin X" work in natural language. Disabling a plugin now
  persists to `~/.moxxy/config.yaml` AND is honored by `pluginHost.reload()`, so a
  disabled plugin is never silently resurrected.

  SDK: `PluginHostHandle.list()` entries carry an optional `kinds` array; new
  `PluginsAdminView` / `InstallablePluginView` / `LoadedPluginView` session
  capabilities back the `/plugins` picker; `SessionOptions` gains an
  `isPluginDisabled` predicate.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d362a6b: Support sending documents (PDFs, Office/text) to the model. Adds a `document`
  `ContentBlock`, a `supportsDocuments` flag on `ModelDescriptor`, and a
  `'document'` `UserPromptAttachment` kind; `projectMessages` routes document
  attachments to the native block. The Anthropic, OpenAI, and Codex providers
  translate documents to their native shapes (Anthropic `document`, OpenAI
  `file`, Responses `input_file`), so attached files now reach the model for
  analysis instead of being dropped.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0afd61d: Make an active mode visually obvious while it's running.

  Modes can now advertise a presentation `badge` (`ModeDef.badge`), surfaced on
  `SessionInfo.activeModeBadge` so every channel sees it over the wire. Goal mode
  declares one, so activating it now shows a persistent indicator the user can't
  miss — even mid-loop, when the usual mode footer is replaced by the "Thinking"
  marker:

  - **TUI** — a reverse-video `GOAL` pill stays pinned to the status line for the
    whole run, alongside the busy spinner.
  - **Desktop** — a persistent accent banner above the composer plus an accented
    Mode chip, both lit/cleared the moment the mode switches.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 93d9a2d: Publish with `pnpm publish` instead of `npm publish` so pnpm's `workspace:*` and `catalog:` protocols are rewritten to concrete version ranges in the published `package.json`.

  The previous `npm publish` shipped those protocols verbatim, so `npx @moxxy/cli init` failed on a clean machine with:

  ```
  npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
  npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
  ```

  Both `@moxxy/cli` (`dependencies."@moxxy/sdk": "workspace:*"`, `zod: "catalog:"`) and `@moxxy/sdk` (`peerDependencies.zod: "catalog:"`) were affected, so both are republished.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c4352f9: First published release of the `moxxy` CLI and SDK (off the `0.0.0` placeholder).
