### Patch Changes

- 00d7425: Desktop mobile gateway: deny-by-default remote command allow-list + gateway hardening.

  **Security fix (critical/high).** The runtime mobile gateway (Settings → Mobile, PR #141) wired the desktop's COMPLETE IPC handler set onto the WebSocket bus and bound the LAN wildcard. The only per-command filter for remote clients was a blocklist that omitted host-mutating commands — so a paired phone (or anyone on the LAN with the bearer token) could invoke `session.setAutoApprove` (disable the desktop's approval prompts, then run any tool unattended), `desks.create`/`rename`/`remove`, `onboarding.saveProviderKey`/`openExternal`, `app.updateCli`/`checkUpdate`/`updateDashboard`, vault/settings/prefs writes, and more — a privilege-escalation / RCE-adjacent hole.

  The model is now **allow-by-default-deny**. `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract` exports `REMOTE_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` — the single source of truth for the remote/mobile trust surface (the exact commands a paired chat client needs: session info/runTurn/abort/setMode/newSession/runCommand, transcribe, ask RESPOND, connection discovery/retry, the per-workspace transcript log, and `workflows.list`/`run`/`getRun`). `@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`'s `WebSocketCommandBus` rejects any command not on the list with a coded error, regardless of what handlers the host registered. The Electron (renderer) bus keeps full access — only the WS/remote bus is restricted. `REMOTE_DISALLOWED_COMMANDS` is kept (deprecated) for renderer affordance-gating but no longer drives enforcement.

  **Finding 2 (medium).** Workflow AUTHORING is host-only: `workflows.save`, `workflows.validateDraft`, and `workflows.setEnabled` are NOT on the remote allow-list — a paired phone cannot rewrite or re-enable the host's workflows. Read + run (`list`/`getRun`/`run`) stay allowed.

  **Finding 3 (medium, stability).** `MobileGatewayManager` start/stop/setEnabled/rotate/resume now serialize through a lifecycle lock, so a rapid off→on toggle (or a boot resume racing a user toggle) can't double-bind the port or leak a LAN-bound listener.

  **Finding 4 (medium).** Token rotation is now coherent with a pinned `MOXXY_WS_TOKEN`: rotation is a no-op-with-warning when the env token pins the credential (it can't be rotated from here without diverging the advertised connectUrl from the live accepted token), and `status()`/`connectUrl` always reflect the live accepted token.

  **Finding 5 (medium, security UX).** The Mobile tab warning now states plainly that the connection is unencrypted plain `ws://`, so anyone on the network can passively intercept the pairing token and all traffic without the QR — use only on trusted networks.

  The standalone `moxxy mobile` host (`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`) is its own trust surface (it registers a curated single-session subset) and opts out of the contract allow-list via `new WebSocketCommandBus({ allowedCommands: null })`. The wave-5 hardening (Origin default-deny, bearer subprotocol auth, connection caps, slow-reader eviction) is unchanged and still applies on the runtime-gateway path.

### Patch Changes

- 0326fb0: Harden the desktop/mobile WebSocket bridge (2026-06-09 audit, wave 5):

  - Reject browser-Origin upgrades unless allow-listed (`allowedOrigins`, default deny; native clients are unaffected).
  - Move the pairing token out of the URL: `Authorization: Bearer` or a `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` bearer entry are the supported presentations; the legacy `?t=` query is opt-in (`allowQueryToken`, kept on only for the mobile channel's already-paired apps). The QR still carries the token, but the app strips it before connecting.
  - Token rotation end to end: `rotateChannelToken` (sdk, persisted with `createdAt` + 90-day staleness warning), `rotateAuthToken` on the live server (drops existing connections), `rotateWsBridgeToken` (desktop) and `MobileChannel.rotateToken`.
  - Backpressure + lifecycle: connection cap (default 8), slow-reader eviction (backlog above 4 MB past a 10s grace terminates the socket), and `close()` now terminates clients so desktop quit doesn't burn its shutdown timeout.
  - `WsRpcClient` no longer replays abandoned requests after reconnect (outbox cleared, queued requests rejected on disconnect) and stops reconnecting after a capped exponential backoff, surfacing a terminal `disconnected` status.
  - Hygiene: empty `MOXXY_WS_PORT` no longer binds an ephemeral port, the server reports the actually-bound port, and the desktop bridge reuses the shared sdk token persistence (userData location kept).

### Minor Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.
