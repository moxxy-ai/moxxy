### Patch Changes

- d0e0bd2: Desktop workspaces now hold multiple sessions: desks persist a session list (v1 docs migrate so the first session keeps the desk's id and resumes its existing logs), the runner pool is keyed by session id (one `moxxy serve` per session), new `sessions.list/create/setActive/remove/rename` IPC commands (list/create/setActive/rename remote-allowed for mobile; remove host-only), and the sidebar shows the active desk's sessions with new/rename/delete affordances — `session.newSession` keeps its reset-current semantics. The desktop also gains dark mode (light/dark/system in Settings → Appearance, persisted in prefs, nativeTheme-synced, Clerk modals themed; designed `darkTokens` palette with CI-enforced light/dark parity), the workflow builder becomes a true infinite canvas (pan both axes unbounded, cursor-anchored zoom 10–400%, zoom-to-fit, persisted viewport), and self-update is honest about runner-protocol bumps: such releases report "requires full update" with a release-page link instead of staging a bundle the bootstrap would refuse and claiming success, update diagnostics explain boot-time refusals, and floor boots after a relaunch no longer inherit the previous override's identity.
