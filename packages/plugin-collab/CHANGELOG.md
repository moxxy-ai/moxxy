### Minor Changes

- 27bfaf6: feat(collaborative): agentic collaborative mode — a team of separate agents working in parallel

  A new selectable `collaborative` mode runs a _team_ of full, **separate** agent
  runner processes on one task (instead of in-process subagents). An **architect**
  agent designs the plan + shared **contracts** and proposes the roster (you
  approve/adjust); **implementer** agents then build in parallel, each in its own
  git **worktree**, coordinating over a new cross-process **collaboration hub**:

  - **`@moxxy/plugin-collab`** — the hub: a unix-socket message bus, a task board
    that doubles as an exclusive **file-lock** arbiter, a **contract registry**
    (publish → propose-change → ack → commit), **peer-read** (one agent reads
    another's in-progress files), crash detection, and **human step-in**
    (pause / resume / directive) — plus the peer `collab_*` tools and the
    `/collab_say` `/collab_direct` `/collab_pause` `/collab_resume` commands.
  - **`@moxxy/mode-collaborative`** — the coordinator (`collaborative`) + the
    internal `collab-architect` / `collab-peer` modes, the peer-process supervisor,
    the git worktree + **staged, ownership-resolved merge** engine (the user's
    branch is only advanced on a clean, atomic promote; conflicts never leave
    markers), and a user-configurable `CollabConfig`. Falls back to a **sequential
    single-workspace** run when git is unavailable (e.g. desktop users without git).
  - **`moxxy agent`** — an internal headless peer-runner subcommand.
  - **UI** — a folded `CollaborationBlock` in `@moxxy/chat-model`; an inline
    team-summary card in chat; and a dedicated **Collaborate** desktop workspace
    (agents · tasks · contracts rail, a `# All` / `@agent` channel selector, and a
    step-in composer) plus a compact TUI `collab` view.

  No runner-protocol bump (the hub has its own versioned protocol; collaboration
  events ride the existing `plugin_event` stream).
