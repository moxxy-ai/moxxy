# @moxxy/design-tokens

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d0e0bd2: Desktop workspaces now hold multiple sessions: desks persist a session list (v1 docs migrate so the first session keeps the desk's id and resumes its existing logs), the runner pool is keyed by session id (one `moxxy serve` per session), new `sessions.list/create/setActive/remove/rename` IPC commands (list/create/setActive/rename remote-allowed for mobile; remove host-only), and the sidebar shows the active desk's sessions with new/rename/delete affordances — `session.newSession` keeps its reset-current semantics. The desktop also gains dark mode (light/dark/system in Settings → Appearance, persisted in prefs, nativeTheme-synced, Clerk modals themed; designed `darkTokens` palette with CI-enforced light/dark parity), the workflow builder becomes a true infinite canvas (pan both axes unbounded, cursor-anchored zoom 10–400%, zoom-to-fit, persisted viewport), and self-update is honest about runner-protocol bumps: such releases report "requires full update" with a release-page link instead of staging a bundle the bootstrap would refuse and claiming success, update diagnostics explain boot-time refusals, and floor boots after a relaunch no longer inherit the previous override's identity.

### Minor Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.
