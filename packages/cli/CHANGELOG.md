## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 640d036: Performance pass (audit-driven, golden-tested for byte-identity)

  Algorithmic-complexity fixes; every algorithm-shape change is guarded by a test
  asserting the new path is byte-identical to the old, so behaviour is unchanged.

  - **Event log / projection (`@moxxy/sdk`, `@moxxy/core`, `@moxxy/runner`):**
    index `EventLog.ofType`/`byTurn` (O(n) filter → O(matches), property-tested
    equal to the old filter); `applyLazyTools` single-partition + index-backed
    loaded-tool scan; `projectMessages` binary-cursor compaction-range lookup;
    `computeElisionState` fused passes + no redundant sort; `surfaceInputParamsSchema`
    O(keys) size guard instead of `JSON.stringify` per frame.
  - **Chat-model block fold (`@moxxy/chat-model`, `@moxxy/client-core`, TUI,
    desktop):** the O(n²)/turn re-fold is now incremental — only the unsettled tail
    re-folds, keyed on a high-water mark — with a golden test feeding events one at
    a time and asserting deep-equality with a full re-fold after every event. Bounds
    the live in-memory log / `seenIds` / `usage.perCall`; memoizes the workflow
    canvas topology so a node drag no longer recomputes it per pointer-move.
  - **Quadratic / unbounded hotspots:** `UsagePanel` peak via reduce (was a
    `Math.max(...series)` spread that RangeError'd on long sessions), `grep` file
    size cap + binary skip, `StreamingPreview` incremental last-line (fixed an
    infinite loop on leading-newline content), terminal sentinel-regex compiled
    once + tail scan, webhooks parse-body-once, scheduler batched schedule
    reconcile, `runProcess` concat-once, and a one-time session-log `ensureReady`.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- 1e1b1d3: Fix the desktop agentic surfaces being undrivable: you couldn't type into the
  terminal and the browser wouldn't navigate.

  - **Surfaces were destroyed out from under their viewer (core).** A surface is
    shared (the agent's tool + the viewer drive one PTY/page), but `SurfaceHost`
    tore the instance down on the first `close`. React StrictMode (dev) makes that
    routine: it mounts → unmounts → remounts, so the first mount's late-resolving
    `open` fires a `close` that destroyed the instance the remount had just
    attached to. Output kept flowing (from the snapshot) so it looked alive, but
    `surface.input`/`surface.resize` then hit a missing instance and were silently
    dropped — no typing, no navigation, no resize, no error. Fixed with viewer
    ref-counting: the instance is only torn down when the last viewer detaches.
  - **Terminal mounted at the wrong width (desktop).** The context rail animated
    its width open, so xterm's `fit()` measured a mid-slide sliver and the shell
    drew its prompt hard-wrapped narrow (which xterm won't reflow). The rail now
    snaps open so the pane is full-width at mount; the fit is rAF-debounced +
    width-guarded, and the terminal is focused on attach.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- e1fb6a6: Move the copy-pasted Markdown + YAML-subset frontmatter mini-parser into
  `@moxxy/sdk` as a single canonical, zero-dependency module
  (`parseFrontmatterFile` / `parseFrontmatter` / `renderFrontmatter`). It was
  duplicated almost line-for-line between `packages/core/src/skills/parse.ts` and
  `packages/plugin-memory/src/parse.ts`, and the two copies had diverged: the
  plugin-memory copy split inline arrays on bare commas and dropped null/float
  typing.

  The shared module keeps the more-correct `core` behavior — depth- and
  quote-aware inline arrays, `null`/`~`, and float parsing — so both packages now
  share one source of truth with identical parse output (same fields, same
  missing/blank-frontmatter handling, same body offset). `core` and
  `plugin-memory` re-export from the SDK under their existing public names
  (`parseSkillFile`/`ParsedSkillFile`, `parseMdFile`/`ParsedFile`); call sites and
  on-disk formats are unchanged. Adds golden tests pinning the prior behavior.

- e1fb6a6: Add a generic `createJsonFileStore` block to `@moxxy/sdk` capturing the repeated
  whole-file JSON id-collection skeleton (in-memory cache + per-instance write
  mutex + read-modify-write `.slice()` copy + crash-atomic `writeFileAtomic`),
  with parsing/validation and corruption policy supplied by the caller's `load`
  hook so each store keeps its exact on-disk format and error handling.

  Migrate the scheduler and webhooks stores onto it (behavior unchanged: same
  `{ version: 1, … }` pretty-printed format, same silent-reset vs.
  preserve-aside/quarantine corruption policy, same 0600 quarantine sidecar). Fix
  the workflows run-store's non-unique `${file}.tmp` write by routing it through
  the shared `writeFileAtomic` (pid+uuid temp → no concurrent-writer collision,
  no orphan temp on failure).

  The vault store (encrypted, passphrase-keyed, 0600) and the provider-admin
  store (name-keyed, versionless, trailing-newline format) are intentionally left
  on their existing — already invariant-compliant — `createMutex` +
  `writeFileAtomic` since they are not id-collections.

- e1fb6a6: Quality sweep, wave 2 (audit-driven, all gates green)

  Continues the 2026-06-18 monorepo sweep (`.claude/audits/`). Behavior is
  unchanged except for the documented bug fixes; every fix ships with a test.

  - **Dedup/generics onto shared homes:** route home-path derivations through the
    SDK `moxxyHome`/`moxxyPath` (fixes a latent `MOXXY_HOME` mismatch), one shared
    `refreshAndStore` for OAuth, a shared external-store helper in client-core, and
    one-shot provider calls routed through the shared SDK collector.
  - **Confirmed logic/correctness fixes (~50):** workflows (yaml block-scalar
    comment corruption, loop-exit determinism, hard-failure wave break, nested
    awaitInput, resume re-emit, sibling-name run resolution, paused-run reporting),
    desktop/client (SkillsView edit-clobber, command-palette dispatch, StrictMode
    double-IPC, ask-respond failure recovery, onboarding unhandled rejection, mic
    stream leak), and assorted fixes across core/cli/channels/providers/isolators.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 89ad994: Repo-wide quality + performance sweep (audit-driven, all gates green)

  A monorepo audit (report in `.claude/audits/quality-sweep-2026-06-18.md`) drove
  three test-backed waves. Behavior is unchanged except for the bug fixes below.

  **SDK (new public helpers):** `assertNever`, `writeFileAtomicSync`,
  `compareSemver`/`parseSemverCore`, and `countNodes` are now exported from
  `@moxxy/sdk` as the single home for those patterns.

  **Dead code & consistency:** removed the orphaned CDP screencast plumbing in
  `plugin-browser` and ~16 other proven-unused exports/modules; replaced the only
  banned private-field-poke cast with a DI seam; deduped repeated helpers onto
  shared homes (SearchBox, diff helpers, token estimate, semver, countNodes).

  **Security / correctness fixes:** view-spec `isSafeViewUrl` whitespace XSS
  bypass (parser + renderer walls); capability-broker SSRF-via-redirect,
  symlink/TOCTOU, and unbounded-buffer hardening; permission deny-rules now fail
  closed on an invalid regex; OAuth refresh race + stale-token-field fixes;
  isolator SIGKILL escalation, cwd, and abort-signal wiring; bounded validation on
  remote-reachable IPC commands; refusal to overwrite a built-in provider; an
  unbounded `completedTurns` leak; and several resource/timer/listener leaks.

  **Generics & atomicity:** extracted `ActiveDefRegistry`/`DefMapRegistry` bases
  (8 copy-paste registries → thin subclasses) and `defineOpenAICompatProvider`
  (per-vendor copy-paste collapsed); closed invariant-#5 gaps by adding
  per-instance mutexes + atomic writes to the file-backed stores that lacked them.

  Larger/riskier items (the O(n²) chat-model fold rewrite, a generic JSON store,
  god-file splits, and the long-tail findings) are tracked in `TECH_DEBT.md` for
  focused follow-up PRs rather than bundled here.

  - @moxxy/sdk@0.13.0

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 22b2c3c: Fix three bugs in the desktop agentic surfaces (terminal / browser / resizable rail):

  - **Rail wasn't resizable.** The drag handle is absolutely positioned, but
    `.col-rail` had no `position`, so it anchored to a far ancestor and landed
    off-screen — the divider looked draggable but nothing grabbed it. Anchor the
    handle to the rail, keep it inside the clip box, and drop the width transition
    mid-drag so the rail tracks the pointer 1:1.
  - **Terminal was shredded and unusable.** xterm's `fit()` ran synchronously on
    mount while the rail was still sliding open (≈0 width), locking the terminal —
    and the PTY it resized — to ~1–2 columns, so every character wrapped. Fit only
    once the pane has real layout (deferred + `ResizeObserver`-driven, width-guarded),
    and focus the terminal once the surface is attached so typing works immediately.
  - **Browser was stuck on "Loading…".** The CDP `Page.startScreencast` push emits
    no frames for a blank/static/headless page and swallowed its own failure, so the
    pane spun forever. Stream the page by polling a JPEG `frame` (always yields a
    frame, works on any Playwright browser) and surface a real error/launch status
    instead of an indefinite spinner.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 33e9640: Agentic surfaces: repurpose the desktop context rail into a dropdown of shared,
  agent-drivable panes.

  - New swappable **Surface** block in the SDK (`defineSurface`, `SurfaceRegistry`,
    `SurfaceHost`) + runner protocol **v8** (`surface.*` methods + `surface.data`
    stream) so a runner-owned interactive resource (a PTY, a browser page) streams
    to a thin client and takes its input back — no reverse RPC.
  - **Terminal** (`@moxxy/plugin-terminal`): a shared shell the user and the agent
    drive together via a new `terminal` tool; rendered live with xterm.js. Ships a
    real PTY via node-pty (optional native dep, N-API) with a dependency-free
    piped-shell fallback.
  - **Browser**: a live, in-window view of the agent's Playwright page on
    `@moxxy/plugin-browser`, streamed over a CDP screencast (`Page.startScreencast`)
    — the user and agent share one page; clicks/keys/scroll/navigation are proxied
    to it.
  - **Files changed**: a git-aware file list with the diff on the right; clicking a
    file opens a dropdown to Add it to the agent or Open it (diff/content). New
    `workspace.readFile` + `git.{isRepo,status,diff}` desktop IPC.
  - The context button now opens a dropdown (Terminal / Files changed / Browser)
    instead of toggling; the rail is drag-resizable with a persisted width.

- 143264a: Desktop OAuth providers now sign in for real instead of showing a "run `moxxy login` in a terminal" hint.

  Settings → Providers (and the onboarding wizard) drive a shared `OAuthSignIn` flow that spawns `moxxy login <provider>`, opens the browser, and — for out-of-band providers like `claude-code` — collects the pasted `claude setup-token` or `code#state` in the UI (browser-authorize primary, token paste as a fallback). Loopback providers (openai-codex) keep their automatic browser+callback flow.

  Mechanics: `moxxy login --stdin-prompts` relays each interactive prompt to the host as a NUL-bracketed marker on stdout (new `encodeLoginPrompt` / `createLoginStreamScanner` in `@moxxy/sdk`) and reads answers as stdin lines, so a GUI host can drive the paste flow without a TTY. The desktop exposes this via new `provider.login.start` / `answer` / `cancel` IPC commands and `provider.login.prompt` / `output` / `done` events; the dead `onboarding.runProviderLogin` command was removed. `onboarding.providerAuthKind` now derives a provider's auth kind from the runner's registry (fixing `claude-code` being mis-detected as an API-key provider) instead of a hardcoded list.

- 951f374: Make the model's reasoning visible, and redesign sub-agents as a collapsible group.

  **Reasoning preview (per-provider, Codex-style between calls).** When enabled, the model's
  thinking now streams live (replacing the silent "thinking…" dots) and is kept as a dim,
  collapsible "Thinking" block interleaved with the tool calls it precedes — so you can see what
  the model is doing instead of waiting out a multi-second pause. Because reasoning is finalized
  once per provider round, summaries land naturally between tool batches.

  It's gated per provider/model via a new `ModelDescriptor.supportsReasoning` capability and turned
  on with `config.context.reasoning` (`true`, or `{ effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' }`):

  - **Anthropic / Claude Code** — adaptive thinking with summarized display; the signed thinking
    block round-trips so interleaved-thinking tool-use continuations stay valid.
  - **OpenAI Codex** — surfaces the reasoning summary it already requests (previously discarded).
  - **OpenAI** — `reasoning_effort` for the gpt-5 family plus the `reasoning_content` summary that
    OpenAI-compatible reasoning backends stream.

  New SDK surface: a `reasoning` `ContentBlock`, `reasoning_delta`/`reasoning_signature`
  `ProviderEvent`s, `reasoning_chunk`/`reasoning_message` events, a `ProviderRequest.reasoning`
  knob, and `ModelDescriptor.supportsReasoning`. No runner protocol bump — reasoning events ride
  the existing event channel.

  **Grouped sub-agents view.** A `dispatch_agent` fan-out now renders as one collapsible group —
  a header (`N Explore agents finished`) over a tree of per-agent rows showing each agent's tool-use
  count, **token usage**, and status — instead of one block per child. Per-agent token totals and the
  agent kind are forwarded on the `subagent_*` events; both the desktop and TUI render the new tree.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f86a7b: Add four built-in LLM providers, available out of the box (no `provider_add`
  needed) and selectable in `moxxy init` / the `/model` picker:

  - **z.ai (Zhipu GLM)** in two modes — `zai` (pay-as-you-go, OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint) and `zai-coding-plan` (GLM Coding Plan, Anthropic-compatible
    endpoint, like Claude Code). Catalog: GLM-5.2 (1M context), GLM-5.1, GLM-5,
    GLM-4.6, GLM-4.5 family, GLM-4.5V (vision).
  - **xAI (Grok)** — `xai`, OpenAI-compatible. Catalog: grok-4.3 (1M context),
    grok-4, grok-4-fast, grok-code-fast-1, grok-3, grok-3-mini.
  - **Google Gemini** — `google`, via Gemini's OpenAI-compatibility endpoint.
    Catalog: gemini-3-pro/flash, gemini-2.5-pro/flash/flash-lite.
  - **Local models** — `local`, any OpenAI-compatible local server (Ollama by
    default, or LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM via `LOCAL_MODEL_BASE_URL`). Needs no
    API key.

  Also refreshes the Anthropic model catalog with the latest Claude models
  (Claude Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Opus 4.6 alongside the existing Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6,
  Haiku 4.5), which the `anthropic` and `claude-code` providers both pick up.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- aacdf1d: Desktop: live registry refresh + interactive provider management.

  The runner now broadcasts `info.changed` after every completed turn, so registry changes made by tools inside a conversation (provider_add, mcp_add, workflow_create, skill writes, …) reach attached clients; the desktop forwards the push to the renderer (`session.info.changed` → `SESSION_INFO_REFRESH_EVENT`) and the Settings panel re-fetches live — no more app restart to see an agent-added provider.

  Settings → Providers is now interactive: enable/disable any provider (runner protocol v7 `provider.setEnabled`, persisted to `preferences.json#disabledProviders` and honored by boot's activation walk; disabling the ACTIVE provider is refused), and a Configure sheet sets the API key (vault + live readiness re-probe via `provider.refreshReady`) and, for runtime-registered providers, the stored baseURL/default model (`provider.configure` through the new `SessionLike.providerAdmin` view). OAuth providers get a `moxxy login` hint instead of a key form.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [aacdf1d]
  - @moxxy/sdk@0.11.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- fee0523: New `moxxy office` channel: a browser pixel-art office game where every animated worker sprite is a full moxxy session. Click a sprite to chat with that agent (streaming, tool calls, permission/approval prompts, slash commands, mode switching, abort); spawn new agents that walk in through the entrance; watch subagents gather in the war room and bubble their progress. Served over the standard authenticated WebSocket IPC bridge, so the game reuses the shared client layer.

### Patch Changes

- 1450973: Virtual office: mouse-wheel / trackpad-pinch zoom (anchored at the cursor) and drag-to-pan, clamped to the office map; sprite clicks now fire on pointer-up with a drag threshold so panning never opens the chat panel.
- 5ab6c78: Fix the WS bridge rejecting real iOS devices at the upgrade handshake. iOS React Native (SocketRocket) sends an `Origin` header derived from the WS URL it dials (ws→http, wss→https) — it is not a browser-only signal — so the Origin default-deny dropped every iPhone pairing with `moxxy mobile` or the desktop gateway. The bridge server now supports `setAllowedOrigins` on the live listener (a tunnel URL is only assigned after start), and both the mobile channel and the desktop mobile gateway allow-list exactly the origins of the URLs they advertise: the tunnel origin, the LAN/loopback connect-URL origin, and the loopback spellings for simulators. Default-deny for everything else is unchanged.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 4c594d8: Wave of desktop/mobile fixes. Runner protocol v6 (additive): clients can supply the turn id (`runTurn.turnId`) so renderer per-turn filters actually match — fixing the silently-broken "generate skill with AI" flow and hidden-turn leaks — and `attach` gains a replay policy (`'full' | 'none' | { tail }`) with EventLog rebase so the desktop no longer replays full session history on app start/desk switch (history comes from the paginated NDJSON log). Desktop settings gain a shared "ask moxxy to do it" background-agent modal: the skill generator is refactored onto it and MCP servers and Providers get Add buttons driving `mcp_add_server`/`provider_add`, with permission asks surfaced in-modal (plus a global ask fallback outside the chat view). Subagents now inherit the parent's resolved model: hallucinated model ids warn and fall back, workflow-trigger spawns use the session's last resolved model, and hardcoded model-id fallbacks are gone. Clerk sign-in returns to the app instead of stranding on the hosted My-account page (explicit fallback redirect URLs + a main-process account-portal recovery handler). Workflow canvas: Delete/Backspace removes the selected node and dropping a connector on empty canvas opens an insert-node menu. Mobile: reconnects re-prime the connection store (fixes the deaf "Connected" state after a runner restart), gateway URL commits on blur, the redundant header actions toggle is gone, menu entries are chips, executed tools open a diagnostics panel on tap, and the QR scanner starts scanning immediately.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- ad989eb: Workflow builder UX: the canvas pans by dragging the background (grab cursor; node drag / connection drag / click-to-deselect unaffected), the header controls (Back / validity badge / Save) align to the name/description input row instead of floating centred, and schema validation errors read as plain English anchored to the step — `step "greet": prompt must not be empty` instead of `steps.0.prompt: String must contain at least 1 character(s)` — so the builder can pin them to the offending node card.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2796066: feat(workflows): human-in-the-loop awaitInput — resume RPC + operator reply UI (un-gate)

  A workflow step can set `awaitInput: true` to pause and ask the operator a
  question, then continue with their reply. #146 gated this at validate/save time
  because the resume path hadn't shipped. The resume path now ships, so the gate
  is removed.

  - **Un-gate:** `awaitInput: true` is accepted again on **prompt/skill steps**
    (rejected on tool/workflow/logic/loop steps and on a loop body); `draft.ts`
    teaches the mid-run pause flow again with a worked example.
  - **Resume RPC (additive, protocol v5):** new `RunnerMethod.WorkflowResume`
    (`workflow.resume`) — server handler → `session.workflows.resume(runId, reply)`;
    `WorkflowsView.resume` (SDK) + CLI impl over the existing `resumeWorkflowRun`;
    `RemoteSession` client method gated on server protocol `>= 5` with the actionable
    "update the CLI" error (mirrors the v4 builder gate). `MIN_COMPATIBLE` stays at 1.
  - **Desktop / mobile / TUI:** `workflows.resume` added to the desktop IPC contract
    (+ host handler), the MobileSessionHost bridge, and `REMOTE_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`
    (RESPOND-only — answering a question the workflow asked, like `ask.respond`).
    Operator reply UI: desktop paused-workflow card (new client-core
    `usePausedWorkflows` hook) and TUI inline reply in the `/workflows` panel.
  - **Correctness:** the `workflow_paused` event now carries the workflow name +
    step label + question; vars set before a pause survive the checkpoint round-trip;
    `runNow` keeps treating a `paused` result as non-terminal (and the resume side
    delivers the now-completed run to the inbox); the stale-checkpoint sweeper +
    `clearRetainedChildren()`-on-shutdown are kept.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [2796066]
  - @moxxy/sdk@0.10.0

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 4a8ec5d: Workflows round-2 correctness: gate the unshippable `awaitInput` resume, make the visual builder work on the desktop, and fix loop/validation correctness.

  **`awaitInput` is gated (was a hang-forever dead-end).** The executor can pause + checkpoint an `awaitInput` step, but the resume trigger/channel that delivers the operator's reply never shipped to `main` — `resumeWorkflowRun` had zero production callers. So an agent-drafted "ask me, then act" workflow would pause forever, leak a retained child session for the process lifetime, and orphan a checkpoint file. `awaitInput` is now **rejected at validate/save time** with a clear "requires the resume channel, not available in this build" message, and `draft.ts` no longer teaches it (it steers the author to `inputs` fields instead). Defense-in-depth: the CLI runner treats a `paused` result as non-terminal (no inbox delivery), `Session.close()` clears retained child sessions so they can't leak, and a `WorkflowRunStore.sweepStale()` sweeper (7-day TTL, run on workflows boot) reaps orphaned `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` checkpoints. The executor pause/resume path is kept intact so re-enabling is a matter of landing a resume trigger and removing the schema gate.

  **Visual builder works on the desktop now.** The desktop drives a `RemoteSession`, whose workflows view only forwarded `list`/`setEnabled`/`run` — so the builder's `validateDraft`/`save`/`getRun` were `undefined` and threw "not supported on this session". Added a `workflow.validateDraft|save|getRun` runner-RPC family (**protocol bumped to v4**) with RemoteSession client methods + server handlers, so the desktop builder validates/saves/loads against the runner.

  **Loop + validation correctness.** A condition/switch step used as a loop body is rejected (its branch routing was silently ignored). A non-loop-body step that `needs` a loop-body step is rejected (it would stall — body steps are excluded from the main DAG). A loop-body step's own `when` guard and any `needs` other than its loop step / a sibling body step are rejected (body steps run unconditionally each iteration). Logic-step `vars` now drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prototype-pollution guard). Paused-run checkpoints persist + restore `vars` set before the pause. Renaming a workflow via the builder removes the old file/entry instead of leaving an orphaned duplicate (`save(workflow, previousName)`, threaded through the view → IPC → runner RPC → builder hook).

- 6afc4c0: Workflows engine (phase 1 of 2): port the logic-step + agentic-authoring engine onto current main, and add a bounded while-loop node.

  **Engine features ported.** `@moxxy/plugin-workflows` now supports logic steps — `bridge` (extract/transform upstream output into `vars`), `condition` (if/else gate routed by an LLM `{"branch":"then"|"else"}`), and `switch` (multi-way gate routed by case id) — plus a `format: json|plain` field, branch fields (`then`/`else`/`cases`/`default`), a persisted-only `ui.layout` schema (node x/y + viewport, no editor here), agentic YAML authoring (`draft.ts` `buildSystemPrompt`/`draftWorkflow` + the `workflow_create` tool teaching the full schema), LLM branch-predicate parsing (`logic-response.ts`), and `awaitInput` pause/resume for prompt/skill steps (`run-store.ts` checkpoints under `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` + executor `resumeWorkflowRun`). The DAG executor (`executor/dag.ts`) gains `runLogicStep`, `mergeVars`, `applyBranchSkips`, and an `ExecutorContext`, merged surgically onto main's baseline — main's `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` guard and behavior are preserved, as is the CLI's separate inter-workflow `afterWorkflow` cycle guard (`MAX_AFTER_WORKFLOW_CHAIN`, Tarjan SCC). The SDK gains the matching types (`WorkflowLoopAction`, `WorkflowLogicStepFormat`, `WorkflowRunStatus`, `WorkflowUi*`, `awaitInput`, `retainSession`, `SubagentContinueArgs`); core's subagent runtime gains retained-session `continue()`/`release()` (new `run-child.ts` + `registry.ts`) backing the pause/resume flow.

  **New `loop` node.** A `loop: { body: string[], condition: string, maxIterations: 1..50 (default 10) }` action repeats its body steps in order each iteration (resetting their state per pass, honoring `onError`), then evaluates `condition` via the same LLM predicate as a `condition` step. `condition` is the loop's EXIT/GOAL condition — the body repeats UNTIL it is met: `then` = condition met → STOP (continue to the next step), `else` = not yet met → run another iteration. A body step error BREAKS the loop to the next step (the loop returns ok with a "broke on error" note rather than failing the whole workflow), unless that body step sets `onError: continue` (which swallows the error and keeps iterating). It is unmistakably safe: it terminates when the exit condition is met, when a body error breaks it, OR at `maxIterations` (finishing with a clear note, never hanging), and composes with `MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` (a body that calls nested workflows still bottoms out at the depth cap). The iteration cap and the depth cap are independent guards; neither can be defeated by the other. Schema rejects loops combined with `then`/`else`/`cases`/`default`, empty bodies, out-of-range `maxIterations`, unresolvable body ids, and `awaitInput` on a loop.

  **IPC for the upcoming visual builder (phase 2).** Additive, capability-detectable commands `workflows.validateDraft` (parse YAML → errors), `workflows.save` (persist a workflow), and `workflows.getRun` (fetch canonical YAML): zod-validated contract + a desktop-host pass-through handler + new optional `WorkflowsView` methods, with the mobile `MobileSessionHost` extended to parity. The visual builder GUI itself is phase 2 (follow-up).

### Patch Changes

- cf2f651: Audit wave: documentation drift + dead-code cleanup.

  - Removed dead exports: `@moxxy/core`'s unused `selectPendingToolCalls` / `selectCurrentTurn`
    event selectors and `@moxxy/sdk`'s unused voice helpers (`checkTranscriberReady`,
    `resolveTranscriber`, `pickFirstAvailableTranscriber`) — zero importers across the repo.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-telegram` no longer declares `zod` as a dependency (it never imported it).
  - CLI `--help` ENV section now lists the user-facing `MOXXY_*` variables and points at the
    new full table in the README.
  - Docs-only (no release impact): AGENTS.md/README.md architecture lists reconciled against
    the actual package set (mode-default replaces the deleted mode-tool-use; PR #120 client
    layer + channel-web/view/mobile + apps/mobile added), the published `@moxxy/sdk` README
    examples rewritten against the real API, apps/docs corrections (tools-builtin reality,
    testing API, four providers, full package index), and the dead `lint` task removed from
    turbo.json.

- cf2f651: Provider-parity fixes from the 2026-06-09 audit (A36–A38):

  - **Codex (A36):** `req.maxTokens` now reaches the Responses API as `max_output_tokens`; `req.temperature` is documented-unsupported on the Codex backend (gpt-5 reasoning models reject sampling params) and dropped with a one-shot MOXXY_DEBUG note instead of silently; `reasoningEffort` is a live `CodexProviderConfig` option (was pinned to 'medium') and the CLI's codex credential resolver now passes `provider.config` through to the client instead of discarding it.
  - **Runtime openai-compat providers (A37):** registered vendors now report their own name + model catalog on the live client (usage stats / errors / context-window lookups no longer misattributed to 'openai'); vault/env key naming is unified behind `providerApiKeyName`/`storedProviderApiKeyName` in plugin-provider-admin — the CLI honors a stored `envVar` override and maps hyphens to underscores, matching the desktop; `provider_add` model descriptors can declare `supportsDocuments` so attachments stop degrading.
  - **`req.system` contract (A38):** hook-injected system text (e.g. plugin-memory's consolidation nudge) now actually reaches every provider — delivered in addition to system-role messages (anthropic: extra system block after the cache breakpoint; openai: inserted system message; codex: appended to `instructions`). The loop helpers no longer prefill `req.system` with the system prompt, which also removes a duplicated base prompt in codex `instructions`.

- cf2f651: Security: four audit leftovers (A43–A46). MCP server credentials now support `${vault:NAME}` placeholders in env/header values, resolved only at connect time (the persisted mcp.json and the model-visible tool args keep the placeholder; `mcp_add_server`/`mcp_test_server` instruct vault-first). Agent-view URLs are scheme-allow-listed (`https`/`http`/`mailto`/`tel` + relative; `data:image/*` for img src only) at BOTH walls: a canonical `isSafeViewUrl` in the sdk enforced by `parseView` and `validateDoc`, and a render-time re-check in the web frontend that neutralizes `javascript:`/`data:text` hrefs and srcs. `web_fetch` closes its DNS-rebinding TOCTOU by pinning every hop's connection to the SSRF-guard-vetted addresses via an undici dispatcher with a fixed lookup (SNI/cert validation intact). Telegram inline-keyboard callbacks now enforce the same pairing authorization gate as text/voice messages.

### Patch Changes

- 2e4bc37: Stability hardening for the web surface and process recovery (audit A7/A8): port-conflict recovery (web channel EADDRINUSE + runner protocol-mismatch) now verifies the holder is a moxxy process before signalling it and otherwise falls back to an ephemeral port instead of killing whatever listens (e.g. ngrok's UI on 4040); inbound web-surface WS frames are zod-validated and dropped (rate-limited warn) instead of crashing the process; the CLI installs last-resort unhandledRejection/uncaughtException guards.
- f3c798f: Stop CLI probe/light-boot sessions from leaking daemons. A new `probeSession`
  helper boots throwaway sessions with `skipInitHooks` (no scheduler poller, no
  webhooks listener — those now start exactly once, in the real session that
  owns them) and `disableSessionPersistence`, and guarantees the probe is closed
  before returning. Previously `moxxy <channel>` self-host booted three sessions
  and the orphaned probe won the webhooks port bind, so incoming webhooks ran
  turns on an abandoned session and duplicate scheduler pollers raced on the
  schedule store. Converted: the TUI needs-init probe, the `moxxy <command>`
  channel-existence probe, the channel-dispatch light-boots (`moxxy <channel>` /
  `moxxy channels …`), `moxxy schedule` store ops, the schedule-setup telegram
  check, and `moxxy plugins list`.
- 2e4bc37: Security (audit A4): webhook fires now actually enforce the trigger's `allowedTools`.
  The CLI webhook runner runs each fire against a per-fire scoped view of the active
  session — a filtered tool registry (the model only sees the listed tools) plus a
  wrapping permission resolver whose `check` and prompt-free `policyCheck` deny any tool
  outside the list (so the restriction survives goal-mode auto-approve), delegating
  allowed calls to the session's normal resolver chain. An empty `allowedTools` keeps the
  existing full-tool-set contract; the `webhook_create` description and setup guide now
  state exactly what is enforced and that fires run on the active session, not an
  isolated one.
- f297da0: Guard `afterWorkflow` triggers against cycles. Mutual triggers (A↔B, or longer loops) used to re-fire each other forever, burning provider tokens. Each run now carries its trigger chain on the `workflow_completed` event: re-fires that would revisit a workflow already in the chain, or exceed a depth cap of 8, are refused with a clear warning. On top of that, trigger sync statically detects cycles in the `afterWorkflow` graph, warns once naming the cycle, and disables auto-refire for its members (they remain runnable manually or on schedule).

### Minor Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [85f9b91]
  - @moxxy/sdk@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- fab0fb4: Update flows: a real `moxxy update`, a TUI "new version" nudge, and observable desktop self-update.

  - **CLI** — new `moxxy update` command: checks the npm registry, detects how the
    CLI was installed (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun, global or local), and runs the matching
    upgrade after a confirm. `--check`/`--dry-run` report-only, `--yes` to skip the
    prompt. Source checkouts get git advice instead of an install.
  - **TUI** — surfaces a newer published `@moxxy/cli` as a one-line, auto-dismissing
    banner and shows the running version in the status line. The check is cached
    (~12h) and fully non-blocking on startup. (Also fixes the `version` prop being
    dropped before it reached the view.)
  - **Desktop self-update** — the previously-silent fall-back-to-the-floor is now
    observable: a persistent boot-decision log under `<userData>/app/boot-log.json`,
    a reason for every gate that rejects a staged bundle, and a Settings → Dashboard
    → Diagnostics readout. The renderer's boot confirmation is hardened (retry +
    reported failure) so a flaky heartbeat can't make the boot-probe revert a
    healthy update. Adds the `app.updateDiagnostics` / `app.bootHeartbeatFailed` IPC.

- Updated dependencies [eac83e5]
  - @moxxy/sdk@0.6.0

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 9a789fe: Harden `moxxy plugins install`/`remove` against argument injection: the imperative
  install/uninstall path now rejects a flag-like spec (a leading `-`, e.g. `-g` or
  `--registry=…`) before handing it to `npm`, while still accepting the legitimate
  `name@version`, git (`github:`/`git+`/`https://`), and local-path specs. Internal
  cleanup: the duplicated `NPM_NAME_RE` / `diffSnapshot` / `PluginSnapshot` are hoisted
  into one shared module in `@moxxy/plugin-plugins-admin`.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- a2d551f: Desktop: resume a workspace's conversation + model context across app
  restarts, and make `/new` actually start a fresh session.

  The desktop owns and kills its `moxxy serve` child on quit, and each launch
  spawned a bare `serve` that minted a brand-new empty session — so the model
  forgot the whole conversation and the transcript collapsed to just the
  post-restart message (the TUI didn't have this because its long-lived daemon
  survives a window close). Now each per-workspace runner is given a sticky
  session id (its desk id) so it resumes `~/.moxxy/sessions/<id>.jsonl` if present
  and starts fresh under that id on first run.

  - New `SetupOptions.sessionId` / `BuildSessionArgs.sessionId`: "resume-if-present"
    (distinct from `resumeSessionId`, which errors when the log is missing — for
    an explicit `moxxy resume <id>`).
  - `serve` reads `MOXXY_SESSION_ID`; the desktop `RunnerSupervisor`/`RunnerPool`
    pass the workspace's desk id through to it.
  - Renderer: the runner replays its FULL history on every attach (and re-attach
    after a reconnect), so the chat runtime now de-dupes ingested events by id
    (`seenIds`, kept in lockstep across live append, replay, and pagination). This
    makes a resumed replay idempotent and also fixes a latent bug where a transient
    reconnect to a still-alive runner could duplicate the transcript.
  - `/new` now works on its own (previously it did nothing in the desktop — only
    `/clear` was handled). It clears the transcript AND resets the runner via a
    new `session.newSession` IPC → `RunnerSupervisor.resetSession()`, which wipes
    the persisted session log and restarts so the model context truly resets and
    doesn't resurrect on the next launch.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- b928391: Fix auto-compaction and auto-elision silently disabling on unrecognised model
  ids — the agent could grow its context unbounded and lose earlier context.

  `runCompactionIfNeeded` and `runElisionIfNeeded` resolved the model's context
  window via an exact `provider.models.find(m => m.id === ctx.model)` and bailed
  to a permanent no-op when it missed. But `config.model` is a free-form string
  and providers serve ids that aren't in their fixed descriptor list (a newer
  release like `claude-opus-4-8`, a dated id, or a runtime provider-admin model),
  so any such id turned BOTH context-management features off for the whole
  session. A shared `resolveModelContext` now falls back to the provider's first
  descriptor — exactly what the TUI context meter already did — so compaction and
  elision stay active on unlisted ids. The reactive overflow recovery
  (`runCompactionIfNeeded(ctx, { force: true })`) also now runs even when no
  window can be resolved at all, so an over-context turn compacts-and-retries
  instead of dying.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- fad9d6b: Make `moxxy login claude-code` resilient to Anthropic's transient OAuth 500s.

  Anthropic's OAuth endpoints (`claude.ai/oauth/authorize` and the
  `console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token` exchange) intermittently return an
  `Internal server error` on the first hit — the identical request then succeeds
  on retry. The token-exchange 500 previously aborted the whole sign-in, forcing
  a full browser re-auth. `postClaudeToken` now retries transient failures
  (5xx / 429 / network errors) up to 3 attempts with a short backoff, while
  deterministic 4xx (bad/expired/already-used code, `invalid_grant`) still surface
  immediately. On exhaustion the error carries an actionable "wait and re-run"
  hint instead of a raw API dump. The browser sign-in instructions also note that
  the authorize page may need a "Try again" click on the first attempt.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ad26425: Add a `claude-code` provider so Claude Pro/Max subscribers can use moxxy with
  their subscription instead of a pay-as-you-go API key.

  - New `@moxxy/plugin-provider-claude-code`: talks to the standard Anthropic
    Messages API with a Claude Code OAuth bearer token (`anthropic-beta:
oauth-2025-04-20` + the required "You are Claude Code…" system preamble).
  - Two ways to authenticate: paste a token from `claude setup-token` (or set
    `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), or run `moxxy login claude-code` for an
    interactive out-of-band OAuth sign-in. Access tokens refresh automatically.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-provider-anthropic`: `AnthropicProvider` gained an OAuth mode
    (bearer auth + system preamble + refresh-on-401); the API-key path is
    unchanged.
  - `@moxxy/sdk`: `ProviderAuthContext` gained an optional `prompt()` so auth
    flows can ask the user to paste a code/token (used by the out-of-band flow).

### Patch Changes

- e64aa0e: Fix "Mode not registered: tool-use" after the mode rename. A mode name persisted
  anywhere (config `mode:`, `~/.moxxy/preferences.json`, a desktop workspace's
  stored mode, a runner `setMode` RPC, a mid-turn mode hand-off) is now funneled
  through a legacy-name map in `ModeRegistry.setActive`: it tries the literal name
  first and falls back to the current name (`tool-use`→`default`,
  `deep-research`→`research`; the removed `plan-execute`/`bmad`/`developer` →
  `default`). A validly-registered name is never overridden, and a genuinely
  unknown mode still throws. Exposes `migrateModeName(name)` from `@moxxy/sdk`.
- 2615cbf: Polish the TUI: simplify the `/plugins` picker and make slash autocomplete
  scrollable.

  - `/plugins` now uses a few basic tabs — **Providers, Modes, Channels, Tools,
    Others, Installable** — instead of one tab per contribution kind. Disabled
    plugins live under "Others" with an `[off]` badge. Heading is just "Plugins".
  - Modal headers no longer paint a filled background band (it rendered as dark
    "bars" on many terminals) — the title + tabs sit as clean text, with the
    active tab marked by an inverse pill.
  - The `/` slash-command dropdown is no longer capped at 8 entries: it shows a
    scrolling window over the full command set (with `↑ N more` / `↓ N more`),
    so every command is reachable with ↑↓.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b014c3a: Slim the loop modes to three and turn plugin management into a first-class,
  plug/unplug system.

  Modes: the registry now ships only `default` (the Claude Code-style ReAct loop,
  package renamed `@moxxy/mode-tool-use` → `@moxxy/mode-default`, export
  `toolUseModePlugin` → `defaultModePlugin`), `goal` (autonomous auto-approve
  loop), and `research` (mode-name renamed from `deep-research`). The `bmad`,
  `developer`, and `plan-execute` modes are removed. Persisted preferences with
  the old mode names (`tool-use`, `deep-research`) are migrated on read, so
  existing sessions keep working.

  Plugins: the standalone "marketplace" is gone — install/remove/enable/disable
  and the installable-plugin catalog now live in `@moxxy/plugin-plugins-admin`.
  The `moxxy plugins` CLI gains `search`, `install`, `remove`, `enable`,
  `disable`, and `open` subcommands (alongside `list`/`reload`/`new`), and the TUI
  gains a `/plugins` picker (tabbed by plugin kind) to plug/unplug plugins live.
  The model can manage plugins on request via new `search_plugins` (npm registry +
  catalog discovery), `enable_plugin`, and `disable_plugin` tools, plus the
  existing `install_plugin` / `uninstall_plugin` — so "find me a plugin for X and
  install it" / "disable plugin X" work in natural language. Disabling a plugin now
  persists to `~/.moxxy/config.yaml` AND is honored by `pluginHost.reload()`, so a
  disabled plugin is never silently resurrected.

  SDK: `PluginHostHandle.list()` entries carry an optional `kinds` array; new
  `PluginsAdminView` / `InstallablePluginView` / `LoadedPluginView` session
  capabilities back the `/plugins` picker; `SessionOptions` gains an
  `isPluginDisabled` predicate.

### Patch Changes

- d362a6b: Support sending documents (PDFs, Office/text) to the model. Adds a `document`
  `ContentBlock`, a `supportsDocuments` flag on `ModelDescriptor`, and a
  `'document'` `UserPromptAttachment` kind; `projectMessages` routes document
  attachments to the native block. The Anthropic, OpenAI, and Codex providers
  translate documents to their native shapes (Anthropic `document`, OpenAI
  `file`, Responses `input_file`), so attached files now reach the model for
  analysis instead of being dropped.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 6dea644: Fix tool calls getting stuck "running" forever (flipping to error only on the next message). When the stuck-loop detector tripped, `mode-tool-use` (the default mode) and `mode-goal` ended the turn after emitting `tool_call_requested` but before running the call — orphaning it with no `tool_result`. The turn still completed (re-enabling the composer), so the orphaned call spun indefinitely until the next `user_prompt` swept it into an error. Both modes now synthesize a failed result for every already-emitted request before bailing, matching the abort path and the already-correct plan-execute/developer modes. This also stops the provider from rejecting the unresolved tool-use block on the following turn.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0afd61d: Make an active mode visually obvious while it's running.

  Modes can now advertise a presentation `badge` (`ModeDef.badge`), surfaced on
  `SessionInfo.activeModeBadge` so every channel sees it over the wire. Goal mode
  declares one, so activating it now shows a persistent indicator the user can't
  miss — even mid-loop, when the usual mode footer is replaced by the "Thinking"
  marker:

  - **TUI** — a reverse-video `GOAL` pill stays pinned to the status line for the
    whole run, alongside the busy spinner.
  - **Desktop** — a persistent accent banner above the composer plus an accented
    Mode chip, both lit/cleared the moment the mode switches.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0afd61d]
  - @moxxy/sdk@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- df0593b: Add a `Sleep` built-in tool and a new `goal` mode (`/goal <objective>`).

  - **`Sleep` tool** — lets the agent pause for a set duration (`seconds` and/or `ms`, capped at
    5 minutes, abort-aware) to wait on an external/async process before re-checking, instead of
    busy-looping.
  - **`goal` mode + `/goal`** — `/goal <objective>` switches into the new `goal` mode,
    auto-approves every tool call (yolo) for the run, and starts working immediately. Unlike
    tool-use, the loop does NOT end when the model stops emitting tools — it keeps re-prompting
    the model to continue until the model explicitly calls the `goal_complete` tool (success,
    with a summary + evidence) or `goal_abandon` (blocked, needs the user). Every run is bounded
    by an iteration cap, a cumulative token budget, a stuck-loop detector, and no-progress
    detection, and stops immediately on user interrupt (Esc/Ctrl-C). Available in every channel
    via `/mode goal`.

### Patch Changes

- f469c0f: `moxxy init`: provider selection is now a single-choice picker instead of a multi-select.

  Users reported the old multi-select step was unintuitive — it wasn't obvious you had to toggle items on/off, and a required multi-select with nothing checked reads as a dead end. The wizard now uses a single `select` (one provider, pre-highlighted, just press Enter), which also removes the now-redundant "which provider should be primary?" step and renumbers the remaining steps (model → 3, mode → 4, embedder → 5, plugin-security → 6, review → 7). The generated `moxxy.config.yaml` is unchanged in shape, and you can still add more providers afterward via config `fallbacks` or the provider-admin tools. This matches the desktop app's onboarding, which already used a single-provider picker.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- bf8ef82: `moxxy login`: add a `--browser` flag that forces the loopback/browser OAuth flow even when stdin isn't a TTY.

  Previously a GUI host (the desktop app) that spawned `moxxy login <provider>` with piped stdio got the headless device-code flow — the user had to open a URL and type a code by hand. With `--browser`, the CLI runs the loopback flow that opens the system browser automatically and catches the localhost callback, so no copying is needed. (`--no-browser` still forces device-code.)

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- f846b56: `moxxy serve` now boots even when no provider key is configured.

  Previously `serve` activated a provider at startup and exited 1 with `AUTH_NO_CREDENTIALS` when none was found — _before_ binding its socket. Clients (notably the desktop app) then looped forever on "lost the runner / reconnecting" and could never connect to add a provider. `serve` now boots with `tolerateNoProvider` (matching `channels` / `login`): it binds the socket with no active provider, and turns fail with a clear "no provider" error until one is configured.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- f07d698: Remove the two `npm install` deprecation warnings (`prebuild-install`, `boolean`) and slim the default install.

  `@moxxy/cli` no longer installs heavy native optional dependencies by default:

  - **keytar → `@napi-rs/keyring`**: keytar pulls the deprecated `prebuild-install`; `@napi-rs/keyring` ships per-platform NAPI prebuilds with no install scripts. OS-keychain unlock for the vault is preserved (it still falls back to the disk key / passphrase when the native binary is unavailable).
  - **`@huggingface/transformers` and `playwright` are now install-on-demand** (dropped from `optionalDependencies`). Both were already loaded via guarded dynamic `import()`; the local-embeddings and browser features degrade gracefully and prompt to install when first used. This is what pulled `boolean` (via `onnxruntime-node` → `global-agent`).

  Net effect: `npx @moxxy/cli` installs only `@moxxy/sdk`, `zod`, and `@napi-rs/keyring` — no deprecation warnings, smaller and faster.

- e73b51e: `moxxy init`: collect the vault passphrase as a styled first step instead of a bare prompt.

  On a first run the vault needs a passphrase to derive its encryption key. Previously this fired as an unstyled `readline` prompt _before_ the wizard (and before the logo). It's now a `@clack/prompts` `password` step — rendered under the moxxy logo, with a short description — so it reads as the first pre-requirement step of setup, consistent with the rest of the wizard. Threaded via a new `SetupOptions.passphrasePrompt`; headless `init` is unaffected (still uses `MOXXY_VAULT_PASSPHRASE` / the non-TTY guard).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 93d9a2d: Publish with `pnpm publish` instead of `npm publish` so pnpm's `workspace:*` and `catalog:` protocols are rewritten to concrete version ranges in the published `package.json`.

  The previous `npm publish` shipped those protocols verbatim, so `npx @moxxy/cli init` failed on a clean machine with:

  ```
  npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
  npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
  ```

  Both `@moxxy/cli` (`dependencies."@moxxy/sdk": "workspace:*"`, `zod: "catalog:"`) and `@moxxy/sdk` (`peerDependencies.zod: "catalog:"`) were affected, so both are republished.
