## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- fad9d6b: Make `moxxy login claude-code` resilient to Anthropic's transient OAuth 500s.

  Anthropic's OAuth endpoints (`claude.ai/oauth/authorize` and the
  `console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token` exchange) intermittently return an
  `Internal server error` on the first hit — the identical request then succeeds
  on retry. The token-exchange 500 previously aborted the whole sign-in, forcing
  a full browser re-auth. `postClaudeToken` now retries transient failures
  (5xx / 429 / network errors) up to 3 attempts with a short backoff, while
  deterministic 4xx (bad/expired/already-used code, `invalid_grant`) still surface
  immediately. On exhaustion the error carries an actionable "wait and re-run"
  hint instead of a raw API dump. The browser sign-in instructions also note that
  the authorize page may need a "Try again" click on the first attempt.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ad26425: Add a `claude-code` provider so Claude Pro/Max subscribers can use moxxy with
  their subscription instead of a pay-as-you-go API key.

  - New `@moxxy/plugin-provider-claude-code`: talks to the standard Anthropic
    Messages API with a Claude Code OAuth bearer token (`anthropic-beta:
oauth-2025-04-20` + the required "You are Claude Code…" system preamble).
  - Two ways to authenticate: paste a token from `claude setup-token` (or set
    `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), or run `moxxy login claude-code` for an
    interactive out-of-band OAuth sign-in. Access tokens refresh automatically.
  - `@moxxy/plugin-provider-anthropic`: `AnthropicProvider` gained an OAuth mode
    (bearer auth + system preamble + refresh-on-401); the API-key path is
    unchanged.
  - `@moxxy/sdk`: `ProviderAuthContext` gained an optional `prompt()` so auth
    flows can ask the user to paste a code/token (used by the out-of-band flow).

### Patch Changes

- e64aa0e: Fix "Mode not registered: tool-use" after the mode rename. A mode name persisted
  anywhere (config `mode:`, `~/.moxxy/preferences.json`, a desktop workspace's
  stored mode, a runner `setMode` RPC, a mid-turn mode hand-off) is now funneled
  through a legacy-name map in `ModeRegistry.setActive`: it tries the literal name
  first and falls back to the current name (`tool-use`→`default`,
  `deep-research`→`research`; the removed `plan-execute`/`bmad`/`developer` →
  `default`). A validly-registered name is never overridden, and a genuinely
  unknown mode still throws. Exposes `migrateModeName(name)` from `@moxxy/sdk`.
- 2615cbf: Polish the TUI: simplify the `/plugins` picker and make slash autocomplete
  scrollable.

  - `/plugins` now uses a few basic tabs — **Providers, Modes, Channels, Tools,
    Others, Installable** — instead of one tab per contribution kind. Disabled
    plugins live under "Others" with an `[off]` badge. Heading is just "Plugins".
  - Modal headers no longer paint a filled background band (it rendered as dark
    "bars" on many terminals) — the title + tabs sit as clean text, with the
    active tab marked by an inverse pill.
  - The `/` slash-command dropdown is no longer capped at 8 entries: it shows a
    scrolling window over the full command set (with `↑ N more` / `↓ N more`),
    so every command is reachable with ↑↓.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b014c3a: Slim the loop modes to three and turn plugin management into a first-class,
  plug/unplug system.

  Modes: the registry now ships only `default` (the Claude Code-style ReAct loop,
  package renamed `@moxxy/mode-tool-use` → `@moxxy/mode-default`, export
  `toolUseModePlugin` → `defaultModePlugin`), `goal` (autonomous auto-approve
  loop), and `research` (mode-name renamed from `deep-research`). The `bmad`,
  `developer`, and `plan-execute` modes are removed. Persisted preferences with
  the old mode names (`tool-use`, `deep-research`) are migrated on read, so
  existing sessions keep working.

  Plugins: the standalone "marketplace" is gone — install/remove/enable/disable
  and the installable-plugin catalog now live in `@moxxy/plugin-plugins-admin`.
  The `moxxy plugins` CLI gains `search`, `install`, `remove`, `enable`,
  `disable`, and `open` subcommands (alongside `list`/`reload`/`new`), and the TUI
  gains a `/plugins` picker (tabbed by plugin kind) to plug/unplug plugins live.
  The model can manage plugins on request via new `search_plugins` (npm registry +
  catalog discovery), `enable_plugin`, and `disable_plugin` tools, plus the
  existing `install_plugin` / `uninstall_plugin` — so "find me a plugin for X and
  install it" / "disable plugin X" work in natural language. Disabling a plugin now
  persists to `~/.moxxy/config.yaml` AND is honored by `pluginHost.reload()`, so a
  disabled plugin is never silently resurrected.

  SDK: `PluginHostHandle.list()` entries carry an optional `kinds` array; new
  `PluginsAdminView` / `InstallablePluginView` / `LoadedPluginView` session
  capabilities back the `/plugins` picker; `SessionOptions` gains an
  `isPluginDisabled` predicate.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- d362a6b: Support sending documents (PDFs, Office/text) to the model. Adds a `document`
  `ContentBlock`, a `supportsDocuments` flag on `ModelDescriptor`, and a
  `'document'` `UserPromptAttachment` kind; `projectMessages` routes document
  attachments to the native block. The Anthropic, OpenAI, and Codex providers
  translate documents to their native shapes (Anthropic `document`, OpenAI
  `file`, Responses `input_file`), so attached files now reach the model for
  analysis instead of being dropped.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 6dea644: Fix tool calls getting stuck "running" forever (flipping to error only on the next message). When the stuck-loop detector tripped, `mode-tool-use` (the default mode) and `mode-goal` ended the turn after emitting `tool_call_requested` but before running the call — orphaning it with no `tool_result`. The turn still completed (re-enabling the composer), so the orphaned call spun indefinitely until the next `user_prompt` swept it into an error. Both modes now synthesize a failed result for every already-emitted request before bailing, matching the abort path and the already-correct plan-execute/developer modes. This also stops the provider from rejecting the unresolved tool-use block on the following turn.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0afd61d: Make an active mode visually obvious while it's running.

  Modes can now advertise a presentation `badge` (`ModeDef.badge`), surfaced on
  `SessionInfo.activeModeBadge` so every channel sees it over the wire. Goal mode
  declares one, so activating it now shows a persistent indicator the user can't
  miss — even mid-loop, when the usual mode footer is replaced by the "Thinking"
  marker:

  - **TUI** — a reverse-video `GOAL` pill stays pinned to the status line for the
    whole run, alongside the busy spinner.
  - **Desktop** — a persistent accent banner above the composer plus an accented
    Mode chip, both lit/cleared the moment the mode switches.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- df0593b: Add a `Sleep` built-in tool and a new `goal` mode (`/goal <objective>`).

  - **`Sleep` tool** — lets the agent pause for a set duration (`seconds` and/or `ms`, capped at
    5 minutes, abort-aware) to wait on an external/async process before re-checking, instead of
    busy-looping.
  - **`goal` mode + `/goal`** — `/goal <objective>` switches into the new `goal` mode,
    auto-approves every tool call (yolo) for the run, and starts working immediately. Unlike
    tool-use, the loop does NOT end when the model stops emitting tools — it keeps re-prompting
    the model to continue until the model explicitly calls the `goal_complete` tool (success,
    with a summary + evidence) or `goal_abandon` (blocked, needs the user). Every run is bounded
    by an iteration cap, a cumulative token budget, a stuck-loop detector, and no-progress
    detection, and stops immediately on user interrupt (Esc/Ctrl-C). Available in every channel
    via `/mode goal`.

### Patch Changes

- f469c0f: `moxxy init`: provider selection is now a single-choice picker instead of a multi-select.

  Users reported the old multi-select step was unintuitive — it wasn't obvious you had to toggle items on/off, and a required multi-select with nothing checked reads as a dead end. The wizard now uses a single `select` (one provider, pre-highlighted, just press Enter), which also removes the now-redundant "which provider should be primary?" step and renumbers the remaining steps (model → 3, mode → 4, embedder → 5, plugin-security → 6, review → 7). The generated `moxxy.config.yaml` is unchanged in shape, and you can still add more providers afterward via config `fallbacks` or the provider-admin tools. This matches the desktop app's onboarding, which already used a single-provider picker.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- bf8ef82: `moxxy login`: add a `--browser` flag that forces the loopback/browser OAuth flow even when stdin isn't a TTY.

  Previously a GUI host (the desktop app) that spawned `moxxy login <provider>` with piped stdio got the headless device-code flow — the user had to open a URL and type a code by hand. With `--browser`, the CLI runs the loopback flow that opens the system browser automatically and catches the localhost callback, so no copying is needed. (`--no-browser` still forces device-code.)

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- f846b56: `moxxy serve` now boots even when no provider key is configured.

  Previously `serve` activated a provider at startup and exited 1 with `AUTH_NO_CREDENTIALS` when none was found — _before_ binding its socket. Clients (notably the desktop app) then looped forever on "lost the runner / reconnecting" and could never connect to add a provider. `serve` now boots with `tolerateNoProvider` (matching `channels` / `login`): it binds the socket with no active provider, and turns fail with a clear "no provider" error until one is configured.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- f07d698: Remove the two `npm install` deprecation warnings (`prebuild-install`, `boolean`) and slim the default install.

  `@moxxy/cli` no longer installs heavy native optional dependencies by default:

  - **keytar → `@napi-rs/keyring`**: keytar pulls the deprecated `prebuild-install`; `@napi-rs/keyring` ships per-platform NAPI prebuilds with no install scripts. OS-keychain unlock for the vault is preserved (it still falls back to the disk key / passphrase when the native binary is unavailable).
  - **`@huggingface/transformers` and `playwright` are now install-on-demand** (dropped from `optionalDependencies`). Both were already loaded via guarded dynamic `import()`; the local-embeddings and browser features degrade gracefully and prompt to install when first used. This is what pulled `boolean` (via `onnxruntime-node` → `global-agent`).

  Net effect: `npx @moxxy/cli` installs only `@moxxy/sdk`, `zod`, and `@napi-rs/keyring` — no deprecation warnings, smaller and faster.

- e73b51e: `moxxy init`: collect the vault passphrase as a styled first step instead of a bare prompt.

  On a first run the vault needs a passphrase to derive its encryption key. Previously this fired as an unstyled `readline` prompt _before_ the wizard (and before the logo). It's now a `@clack/prompts` `password` step — rendered under the moxxy logo, with a short description — so it reads as the first pre-requirement step of setup, consistent with the rest of the wizard. Threaded via a new `SetupOptions.passphrasePrompt`; headless `init` is unaffected (still uses `MOXXY_VAULT_PASSPHRASE` / the non-TTY guard).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 93d9a2d: Publish with `pnpm publish` instead of `npm publish` so pnpm's `workspace:*` and `catalog:` protocols are rewritten to concrete version ranges in the published `package.json`.

  The previous `npm publish` shipped those protocols verbatim, so `npx @moxxy/cli init` failed on a clean machine with:

  ```
  npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
  npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
  ```

  Both `@moxxy/cli` (`dependencies."@moxxy/sdk": "workspace:*"`, `zod: "catalog:"`) and `@moxxy/sdk` (`peerDependencies.zod: "catalog:"`) were affected, so both are republished.
