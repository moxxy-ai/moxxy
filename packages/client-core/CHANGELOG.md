- c058735: feat(desktop): Apps gallery with install lifecycle + offline document anonymizer

  Adds an **Apps** section (a new top-level header tab next to Chat / Workflows) — a
  registry-backed gallery of self-contained mini-applications. Apps that need local
  assets show a predefined **Install** step that downloads everything they need
  before first use; installation is the only time the network is touched, runs in
  the main process, and is gated behind an explicit click.

  The first app is an **offline document anonymizer**. Paste text or open a
  document (PDF / Office / text, parsed locally via the existing officeparser
  pipeline) and it detects + redacts PII — emails, phone numbers, credit cards
  (Luhn), SSNs, IPs, MACs, IBANs (mod-97), URLs — plus a custom-terms list and an
  **on-device NER** model (`Xenova/bert-base-NER`, ~109 MB, downloaded on install)
  for names, organizations and locations. Redaction runs entirely in the renderer
  (`@moxxy/anonymizer`, a new pure, dependency-free, network-free engine) with
  labeled / pseudonym / hash styles. **Documents never leave the machine**: the
  analyze path touches no provider/runner/network, the CSP `connect-src` stays
  local-only (the NER model is served from a confined `moxxy-app://` scheme over
  `userData/moxxy-apps`), and the engine's emptiness of dependencies is enforced by
  a unit test.

### Minor Changes

- 27bfaf6: feat(collaborative): agentic collaborative mode — a team of separate agents working in parallel

  A new selectable `collaborative` mode runs a _team_ of full, **separate** agent
  runner processes on one task (instead of in-process subagents). An **architect**
  agent designs the plan + shared **contracts** and proposes the roster (you
  approve/adjust); **implementer** agents then build in parallel, each in its own
  git **worktree**, coordinating over a new cross-process **collaboration hub**:

  - **`@moxxy/plugin-collab`** — the hub: a unix-socket message bus, a task board
    that doubles as an exclusive **file-lock** arbiter, a **contract registry**
    (publish → propose-change → ack → commit), **peer-read** (one agent reads
    another's in-progress files), crash detection, and **human step-in**
    (pause / resume / directive) — plus the peer `collab_*` tools and the
    `/collab_say` `/collab_direct` `/collab_pause` `/collab_resume` commands.
  - **`@moxxy/mode-collaborative`** — the coordinator (`collaborative`) + the
    internal `collab-architect` / `collab-peer` modes, the peer-process supervisor,
    the git worktree + **staged, ownership-resolved merge** engine (the user's
    branch is only advanced on a clean, atomic promote; conflicts never leave
    markers), and a user-configurable `CollabConfig`. Falls back to a **sequential
    single-workspace** run when git is unavailable (e.g. desktop users without git).
  - **`moxxy agent`** — an internal headless peer-runner subcommand.
  - **UI** — a folded `CollaborationBlock` in `@moxxy/chat-model`; an inline
    team-summary card in chat; and a dedicated **Collaborate** desktop workspace
    (agents · tasks · contracts rail, a `# All` / `@agent` channel selector, and a
    step-in composer) plus a compact TUI `collab` view.

  No runner-protocol bump (the hub has its own versioned protocol; collaboration
  events ride the existing `plugin_event` stream).

### Patch Changes

- 640d036: perf(chat-model): incrementalize the per-turn block fold (kill the O(n²)/turn re-fold)

  Both the desktop Transcript and the TUI ChatView re-folded the ENTIRE growing
  event array via `pairToolEvents` on every committed event — k full O(n) walks
  per turn, degrading to O(n²) over a session. The fold body is now lifted into a
  reusable `stepFold(state, event)` (the verbatim old loop body) shared by the
  batch `pairToolEvents` and a new `IncrementalFold` that keeps the folded block
  tree alive across renders and re-folds only the unsettled tail past a
  `(version, prefixLength)` high-water mark. `syncTo` extends the prefix on a pure
  append and rebuilds only when it shifts (scroll-up prepend, /clear). A golden
  test feeds many recorded sequences (skill scopes, live tools, subagents, orphan
  results, reasoning, file diffs) one event at a time and asserts the incremental
  tree is byte-identical to `pairToolEvents(fullPrefix)` after EVERY event, plus a
  counter assertion that a k-event turn does O(k) — not O(k²) — step work.

  Also: the TUI settled-prefix scan resumes from its high-water mark instead of
  re-walking from index 0; `WorkflowCanvas` memoizes `topoOrder` on a geometry-free
  topology signature so a node drag no longer recomputes the O(V+E) fold per
  mousemove; and `usage.perCall` is head-capped at 200 entries (lossless for the
  meter — totals still fold every call).

### Minor Changes

- 951f374: Make the model's reasoning visible, and redesign sub-agents as a collapsible group.

  **Reasoning preview (per-provider, Codex-style between calls).** When enabled, the model's
  thinking now streams live (replacing the silent "thinking…" dots) and is kept as a dim,
  collapsible "Thinking" block interleaved with the tool calls it precedes — so you can see what
  the model is doing instead of waiting out a multi-second pause. Because reasoning is finalized
  once per provider round, summaries land naturally between tool batches.

  It's gated per provider/model via a new `ModelDescriptor.supportsReasoning` capability and turned
  on with `config.context.reasoning` (`true`, or `{ effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' }`):

  - **Anthropic / Claude Code** — adaptive thinking with summarized display; the signed thinking
    block round-trips so interleaved-thinking tool-use continuations stay valid.
  - **OpenAI Codex** — surfaces the reasoning summary it already requests (previously discarded).
  - **OpenAI** — `reasoning_effort` for the gpt-5 family plus the `reasoning_content` summary that
    OpenAI-compatible reasoning backends stream.

  New SDK surface: a `reasoning` `ContentBlock`, `reasoning_delta`/`reasoning_signature`
  `ProviderEvent`s, `reasoning_chunk`/`reasoning_message` events, a `ProviderRequest.reasoning`
  knob, and `ModelDescriptor.supportsReasoning`. No runner protocol bump — reasoning events ride
  the existing event channel.

  **Grouped sub-agents view.** A `dispatch_agent` fan-out now renders as one collapsible group —
  a header (`N Explore agents finished`) over a tree of per-agent rows showing each agent's tool-use
  count, **token usage**, and status — instead of one block per child. Per-agent token totals and the
  agent kind are forwarded on the `subagent_*` events; both the desktop and TUI render the new tree.

### Patch Changes

- 7366a09: Add a cross-channel file-diff preview for the Write/Edit tools. Every surface
  now shows what changed when the agent writes a file — a classic diff of the
  changed slices (±2 context lines) with line numbers, `+`/`-` markers, and
  green/red line backgrounds, plus a "Added N lines, removed M lines" summary.

  - The tools return a structured, channel-agnostic payload (`ToolDisplayResult`
    = `{ forModel, display }`); the model still sees only a short summary line, so
    the diff never bloats the context window.
  - TUI: an inline highlight preview; `Ctrl+O` expands the changed files.
  - Desktop: a diff card; click to expand the full set of hunks.
  - Web / Telegram / mobile each render the same payload natively.

  New public SDK surface (`@moxxy/sdk` and the dependency-free `@moxxy/sdk/tool-display`
  subpath for browser/React-Native consumers): `FileDiffDisplay`, `DiffHunk`,
  `DiffLine`, `DiffRow`, `ToolDisplay`, `ToolDisplayResult`, and the helpers
  `isToolDisplayResult`, `isFileDiffDisplay`, `fileDiffSummary`, `fileDiffVerb`,
  `diffGutterNo`, `toDiffRows`.

### Patch Changes

- c15a45a: "Requires full update" releases now install themselves. New `app.updateShell` IPC drives electron-updater against a generic feed pinned at the exact `desktop-v<version>` release assets (GitHub latest/atom discovery can't parse `desktop-v*` tags), streaming download progress over `app.update.progress` and quit-and-installing on completion; the banner/Settings CTA becomes "Update app" with the release page kept as a fallback once an automatic attempt fails. macOS builds add a `zip` target so Squirrel.Mac can apply them, and desktop releases are no longer marked "Latest" on GitHub (`make_latest: false`).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- aacdf1d: Desktop: live registry refresh + interactive provider management.

  The runner now broadcasts `info.changed` after every completed turn, so registry changes made by tools inside a conversation (provider_add, mcp_add, workflow_create, skill writes, …) reach attached clients; the desktop forwards the push to the renderer (`session.info.changed` → `SESSION_INFO_REFRESH_EVENT`) and the Settings panel re-fetches live — no more app restart to see an agent-added provider.

  Settings → Providers is now interactive: enable/disable any provider (runner protocol v7 `provider.setEnabled`, persisted to `preferences.json#disabledProviders` and honored by boot's activation walk; disabling the ACTIVE provider is refused), and a Configure sheet sets the API key (vault + live readiness re-probe via `provider.refreshReady`) and, for runtime-registered providers, the stored baseURL/default model (`provider.configure` through the new `SessionLike.providerAdmin` view). OAuth providers get a `moxxy login` hint instead of a key form.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e1fb70: Sidebar redesign: every workspace is now a collapsible folder with its sessions nested beneath it (collapse state persists per workspace), a new-session [+] sits on each workspace row, and sessions are auto-titled from their first prompt (display-only, derived from the runner's meta sidecar at list time — also served to mobile via sessions.list) while staying renameable inline. client-core's useDesks gains desk-scoped session ops (createSession/setActiveSession/renameSession/removeSession) so the tree can operate across all workspaces at once.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d0e0bd2: Desktop workspaces now hold multiple sessions: desks persist a session list (v1 docs migrate so the first session keeps the desk's id and resumes its existing logs), the runner pool is keyed by session id (one `moxxy serve` per session), new `sessions.list/create/setActive/remove/rename` IPC commands (list/create/setActive/rename remote-allowed for mobile; remove host-only), and the sidebar shows the active desk's sessions with new/rename/delete affordances — `session.newSession` keeps its reset-current semantics. The desktop also gains dark mode (light/dark/system in Settings → Appearance, persisted in prefs, nativeTheme-synced, Clerk modals themed; designed `darkTokens` palette with CI-enforced light/dark parity), the workflow builder becomes a true infinite canvas (pan both axes unbounded, cursor-anchored zoom 10–400%, zoom-to-fit, persisted viewport), and self-update is honest about runner-protocol bumps: such releases report "requires full update" with a release-page link instead of staging a bundle the bootstrap would refuse and claiming success, update diagnostics explain boot-time refusals, and floor boots after a relaunch no longer inherit the previous override's identity.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2796066: feat(workflows): human-in-the-loop awaitInput — resume RPC + operator reply UI (un-gate)

  A workflow step can set `awaitInput: true` to pause and ask the operator a
  question, then continue with their reply. #146 gated this at validate/save time
  because the resume path hadn't shipped. The resume path now ships, so the gate
  is removed.

  - **Un-gate:** `awaitInput: true` is accepted again on **prompt/skill steps**
    (rejected on tool/workflow/logic/loop steps and on a loop body); `draft.ts`
    teaches the mid-run pause flow again with a worked example.
  - **Resume RPC (additive, protocol v5):** new `RunnerMethod.WorkflowResume`
    (`workflow.resume`) — server handler → `session.workflows.resume(runId, reply)`;
    `WorkflowsView.resume` (SDK) + CLI impl over the existing `resumeWorkflowRun`;
    `RemoteSession` client method gated on server protocol `>= 5` with the actionable
    "update the CLI" error (mirrors the v4 builder gate). `MIN_COMPATIBLE` stays at 1.
  - **Desktop / mobile / TUI:** `workflows.resume` added to the desktop IPC contract
    (+ host handler), the MobileSessionHost bridge, and `REMOTE_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`
    (RESPOND-only — answering a question the workflow asked, like `ask.respond`).
    Operator reply UI: desktop paused-workflow card (new client-core
    `usePausedWorkflows` hook) and TUI inline reply in the `/workflows` panel.
  - **Correctness:** the `workflow_paused` event now carries the workflow name +
    step label + question; vars set before a pause survive the checkpoint round-trip;
    `runNow` keeps treating a `paused` result as non-terminal (and the resume side
    delivers the now-completed run to the inbox); the stale-checkpoint sweeper +
    `clearRetainedChildren()`-on-shutdown are kept.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- a1e5df1: Workflows visual builder GUI (phase 2 of 2): a drag-canvas on desktop + an outline editor on mobile, both built on one shared, DOM-free model.

  **New shared model — `@moxxy/workflows-builder`.** A genuinely DOM-free, RN-safe package (zero React, zero DOM, zero node built-ins — proven by the Expo iOS export) that both apps import. It holds: the canvas `BuilderState` + a typed `builderReducer`; pure operations (`addStep`/`removeStep`, `connectNeeds`/`disconnectNeeds`, `setBranchTargets`/`setSwitchCase`, `setLoopBody`/`setLoopExit`/`setLoopConfig`, `moveNode`/`setViewport`/`renameNode`/`updateNode`/`updateMeta`); a `serialize`↔`hydrate` pair that builds a `Workflow` object + `ui.layout` from the canvas and re-derives the node graph (incl. an auto-layout when `ui.layout` is absent); a dependency-free YAML codec scoped to the workflow shape (chosen over the `yaml` package, which reaches for `node:process`, so the RN bundle stays clean — authoritative validation is server-side); and the validate/save bridges that map `workflows.validateDraft` issues back onto the offending nodes. 32 unit tests cover operations, the serialize↔hydrate round-trip (loop body + exit + branches + layout), validation-error mapping, and the loop node's body/exit modeling.

  **The loop node's two-region visual model.** A `loop` node exposes (1) a BODY region — the steps that run inside the loop each iteration, toggled in the inspector and rendered as dashed "body" edges — and (2) a single EXIT edge to the next step, taken when the condition is met OR a body step errors, labeled "on done / error → next". The exit is modeled as the body-excluded step that `needs` the loop, so there's always exactly one exit edge and the on-disk schema is unchanged.

  **Desktop canvas (`apps/desktop/src/workflows/`).** `WorkflowsPanel` becomes a list↔builder switcher (keeping enable/disable + run-now + last-run, adding per-row Edit + New). The builder is a hand-rolled SVG drag-canvas (no react-flow — the graph is ≤40 nodes, so a graph lib's bundle cost wasn't justified): color-coded node cards per step kind, derived `needs`/branch/loop edges with labels, draggable nodes that persist x/y to `ui.layout`, a node inspector (edits each kind's action fields incl. the loop's body/exit/condition/maxIterations), an add-node palette, live validation that decorates the offending node, and Save (`validateDraft`→`save`). 7 testing-library tests.

  **Mobile editor (`apps/mobile/`).** New `app/workflow-edit.tsx` screen + `WorkflowEditor` component + `useWorkflowEditor` hook, consuming the same shared model over the mobile frame bridge (new `buildWorkflowValidateFrame`/`buildWorkflowSaveFrame`/`buildWorkflowDetailFrame`, wired to the `MobileSessionHost` handlers the engine added). v1 is an OUTLINE editor (a node list with the same operations, incl. the loop's body/exit/condition), not a touch-drag canvas — a graphical touch canvas was disproportionate for v1.

  **Shared IPC glue.** `client-core` gains `useWorkflowBuilder` (DOM-free) that drives `workflows.getRun`/`validateDraft`/`save` over the injected transport — the Electron preload bridge on desktop, the WebSocket bridge on mobile — so the validate/save flow is identical across platforms.

- 4a8ec5d: Workflows round-2 correctness: gate the unshippable `awaitInput` resume, make the visual builder work on the desktop, and fix loop/validation correctness.

  **`awaitInput` is gated (was a hang-forever dead-end).** The executor can pause + checkpoint an `awaitInput` step, but the resume trigger/channel that delivers the operator's reply never shipped to `main` — `resumeWorkflowRun` had zero production callers. So an agent-drafted "ask me, then act" workflow would pause forever, leak a retained child session for the process lifetime, and orphan a checkpoint file. `awaitInput` is now **rejected at validate/save time** with a clear "requires the resume channel, not available in this build" message, and `draft.ts` no longer teaches it (it steers the author to `inputs` fields instead). Defense-in-depth: the CLI runner treats a `paused` result as non-terminal (no inbox delivery), `Session.close()` clears retained child sessions so they can't leak, and a `WorkflowRunStore.sweepStale()` sweeper (7-day TTL, run on workflows boot) reaps orphaned `~/.moxxy/workflow-runs/active/` checkpoints. The executor pause/resume path is kept intact so re-enabling is a matter of landing a resume trigger and removing the schema gate.

  **Visual builder works on the desktop now.** The desktop drives a `RemoteSession`, whose workflows view only forwarded `list`/`setEnabled`/`run` — so the builder's `validateDraft`/`save`/`getRun` were `undefined` and threw "not supported on this session". Added a `workflow.validateDraft|save|getRun` runner-RPC family (**protocol bumped to v4**) with RemoteSession client methods + server handlers, so the desktop builder validates/saves/loads against the runner.

  **Loop + validation correctness.** A condition/switch step used as a loop body is rejected (its branch routing was silently ignored). A non-loop-body step that `needs` a loop-body step is rejected (it would stall — body steps are excluded from the main DAG). A loop-body step's own `when` guard and any `needs` other than its loop step / a sibling body step are rejected (body steps run unconditionally each iteration). Logic-step `vars` now drop `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prototype-pollution guard). Paused-run checkpoints persist + restore `vars` set before the pause. Renaming a workflow via the builder removes the old file/entry instead of leaving an orphaned duplicate (`save(workflow, previousName)`, threaded through the view → IPC → runner RPC → builder hook).

### Minor Changes

- 85f9b91: Share the desktop client layer across platforms and expose the IPC over a WebSocket.

  The desktop renderer's hooks, state stores, chat model, and IPC client are now
  transport- and platform-agnostic so a future mobile app can reuse them:

  - **`@moxxy/client-core`** — the `use*` hooks + chat/connection/ask stores + chat
    model + the transport singleton + a platform-capability registry. DOM-free; the
    desktop renderer consumes it via thin `@/lib/*` shims (no behavior change).
  - **`@moxxy/client-platform-web`** — the Web implementations of those capabilities
    (mic capture/PCM16, Web Speech TTS, localStorage, window event bus).
  - **`@moxxy/design-tokens`** — framework-neutral tokens + a `:root` CSS generator.
  - **`@moxxy/client-transport-ws`** — a `MoxxyApi` over the global `WebSocket`
    (no Node deps), for remote clients.
  - **`@moxxy/ipc-server-ws`** — serves the same `IpcCommands`/`IpcEvents` contract
    over an authenticated WebSocket (loopback by default, bearer-token gated). The
    desktop's IPC handler registration is now transport-neutral (a `CommandBus`/
    `EventSink` seam + a shared `dispatch` core in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`), so the
    same handler bodies serve Electron IPC and the WebSocket; events fan out to both.
  - **`@moxxy/plugin-channel-mobile`** — a `mobile` channel that serves the bridge from
    the CLI backed by the runner's single session: `moxxy mobile` (and `moxxy serve --all`)
    expose it with no desktop needed. It can reach beyond the LAN via a cloudflared/ngrok
    tunnel (`channels.mobile.tunnel`) and prints a **QR code** (URL + token embedded) to
    pair. The desktop bridge stays opt-in via `MOXXY_WS_BRIDGE`.
  - **`@moxxy/sdk`** — adds `resolveChannelToken` + `bearerGuard`: the standard channel
    auth-token resolution (env → `channels.<name>.token` → a persisted secret) and a
    pre-connection bearer handler, so channels gate connections uniformly. The mobile
    bridge + WS server adopt them.

  A new `apps/mobile` Expo proof-of-concept drives the chat loop (and permission prompts)
  through the shared hooks over the WebSocket bridge — against either backend. First launch
  shows a QR scanner that pairs by scanning `moxxy mobile`'s code. Desktop behavior is
  unchanged.
