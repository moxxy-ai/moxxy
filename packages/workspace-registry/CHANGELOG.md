## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3862cb2: Unify sessions into a single source of truth across TUI / desktop / mobile.

  A session now lives in exactly ONE place — its per-session file
  `~/.moxxy/sessions/<id>.json` (the conversation stays in the append-only
  `<id>.jsonl`). `~/.moxxy/desktop/desks.json` is reduced to a thin workspace
  overlay (desk definitions + active pointers); the per-desk session list is
  DERIVED from the session files at read time and grouped by an explicit `groupId`
  (falling back to cwd for CLI/TUI sessions). Deleting a session = erasing its file,
  so a removed session/workspace can never resurrect — which removes the whole class
  of "deleted workspace comes back after restart" bugs and deletes ~300 lines of
  copy/reconciliation code (`syncSessionIndexIntoRegistry`, `registerSessionFromMeta`,
  partial-resume detection, legacy name hydration, the `withSessionTitles` pass).

  - `@moxxy/core`: the session metadata file (`<id>.json`, versioned) gains
    `source` (originating channel), `groupId` (workspace membership) and `title`
    (user rename). New helpers: `listSessionMetas` (cheap, mtime-cached, single
    `readdir`), `seedSessionMeta`, `setSessionTitle`, `setSessionGroup`. The runner
    adopts a file's stable identity (`startedAt`/`source`) and PRESERVES the
    UI-owned `title`/`groupId` across its writes, so a live runner never clobbers a
    rename/move. `deleteSession` is the single deletion mechanism.
  - `@moxxy/workspace-registry`: derives the desk/session view from the session
    files with an mtime-parse cache; `moveSession` re-homes a session by `groupId`.
  - `@moxxy/desktop-host`: a sessions-dir watcher pushes a debounced (and
    projection-diffed) `desks.changed` so a title/first-prompt/new-session/deletion
    syncs live to desktop + mobile; the desk-removal flow tears runners down before
    erasing files.
  - No migration: pre-existing sessions may be dropped; old desk _definitions_ are
    read in place (their embedded session arrays are ignored).
