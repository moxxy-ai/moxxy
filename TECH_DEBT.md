# Tech debt — living journal

This is the repo's standing tech-debt ledger. **Treat it as a journal:** read it
before non-trivial work, retire at least one item per change, and log new debt the
moment you see it. See AGENTS.md → "Tech debt is a standing job".

**Pruned 2026-06-24** — the historical saga write-ups and all resolved/"Retired"
entries were compacted away; what remains below is the currently-OPEN backlog as a
scannable summary. Git history holds the full prior journal if you need it.

Severity tags: `[critical]`/`[high]`/`[med]`/`[low]`, `[note]` = standing practice
or recorded-on-purpose decision.

## Standing practices

- **Own debt like a CTO** — read this file before non-trivial work, retire ≥1 item
  per change, log new debt on sight, re-audit subsystems during big work.
- **Rebuild after changes** — turbo cache makes `pnpm build` cheap; run it (and the
  gate) before reporting work done or rebasing onto main.
- **Keep the Claude skill library current** — `.claude/skills/` encodes repo
  conventions; when a convention/command/invariant changes, update the matching
  SKILL.md in the same PR.
- **YAGNI extension seams** — subagent retention constants, discovery concurrency,
  `credentialResolver` capability, per-owner browser sidecar registry, warm
  subprocess pool are consciously deferred (surface/risk for no current win);
  revisit when a concrete need appears.

## Sessions / workspace

- [low, scale] `desks.list` derives in O(N) `stat`s (one `readdir` + a `stat` per
  session file; parses only changed files via the mtime cache). Fine for hundreds–
  low thousands; at very large N a registry-level derived-cache invalidated by the
  sessions-dir watcher would make it O(1). `packages/core/src/sessions/persistence.ts`.
- [low, scale] `desks.changed` ships the full desk list (O(N) payload); a delta
  event (changed desk/session only) would cut cross-device payload to O(1). The
  projection-diff already suppresses per-event churn. `packages/desktop-host/src/sessions-watcher.ts`.
- [low] Standalone `moxxy mobile` empty-session source: seeded `source:'mobile'`,
  but the env-heuristic runner write can later stamp `tui`, dropping an empty
  session from the list until its first prompt. Set `MOXXY_SESSION_SOURCE=mobile`
  on the `moxxy mobile` runner to make it airtight. `packages/plugin-channel-mobile`.
- [note] Stress-test multi-session with a desk's SECOND (UUID) session — the first
  session has id === desk id, which masks pool-key regressions. `packages/desktop-host`.
- [low] `SessionSource` literals are still hand-listed in one runtime spot:
  `sessionSource()`'s validator in `packages/cli/src/setup/persistence.ts` (a type
  can't be enumerated at runtime). `DeskSession.source` in `@moxxy/desktop-ipc-contract`
  was unified onto the SDK type (2026-06-26); when adding a source, update the
  union in `@moxxy/sdk` event-store.ts AND that guard.
- [low] TUI `/sessions` switcher only works in self-host/standalone mode (the TUI
  owns the boot, so it can re-bootstrap onto a different session in place). In
  ATTACH mode (thin client against an external `moxxy serve`) the runner owns a
  single fixed session, so the switcher degrades to a notice. True attach-mode
  switching needs a runner-side session pool (like desktop's `RunnerPool`) or a
  spawn-a-second-runner flow; deferred as the larger architectural change.
  `packages/cli/src/commands/run-tui.ts`, `packages/plugin-cli/src/session/sessions-picker.ts`.
- [low] TUI `/sessions` switch re-runs the full `setupSessionWithConfig` per switch
  (re-discovers plugins, re-fires onInit daemons for the new session). Correct but
  not cheap; a warm-registry / session-pool reuse would make switching instant.
  `packages/cli/src/commands/run-tui.ts`.

## Runner / protocol & architecture

- [high, architecture] Retype channel handlers to the SDK contract — `ClientSession`
  still exposes the full concrete registry surface; retype handler params to a
  minimal `SessionLike` slice (and verify graceful degradation) alongside the
  runner/thin-client split. `packages/sdk/src/session-like.ts`, `plugin-cli`, `plugin-telegram`.
- [high, bug] `/new` desync window — renderer clears the store before the runner
  reset confirms; a failure/crash between them resurrects old context. Reset runner
  FIRST, clear on success (or one atomic IPC). **Zero tests** on this path.
  `packages/desktop-host/src/chat-log.ts`, `packages/runner/src/`.

## Desktop / native build & release

- [high] node-gyp 9 too old / 11 hangs `@electron/rebuild@3.6.1` ("preparing
  node-pty"). Real fix is a coupled bump: `@electron/rebuild` 4.x, electron-builder
  25→26, node-gyp 12, Node floor `>=20.17` — verified by an actual packaging run.
  Until then CI pins stay (Python 3.11 + windows-2022); use `verify-desktop-packaged`
  for any node-gyp change. `root pnpm.overrides`, CI.
- [med] Verify Tier-1 hot-update sticks on 0.0.30+; once verified, consider dropping
  the renderer-heartbeat confirm path (fast-path kept). `packages/desktop-host/src/app-update/`.
- [low] Pre-fix releases (≤ desktop-v0.8.0) carry mismatched GitHub asset names
  (manual repair); only new releases are correct.

## Desktop / surfaces & files

- [high, constraint] Surfaces are ref-counted — keep the per-kind refcount balanced
  if adding open/close call sites (a single viewer's close must not destroy a shared
  instance). `packages/core/src/surfaces/host.test.ts`.
- [constraint] Terminal sizing depends on the pane being full-width at mount — never
  push a transient/sub-full column count to a PTY-backed surface. `packages/core/src/surfaces/`.
- [dormant] CDP screencast → screenshot-polling fallback is unused — remove, or
  gate behind the polling fallback if screencast is revived. `plugin-browser/src/sidecar/`.
- [dormant] Piped-shell fallback is intentionally non-interactive — needs CR→LF +
  local echo if a no-prebuild platform ever needs it. `packages/core/src/surfaces/pty.ts`.
- [low] Files pane polls IPC instead of streaming via the Surface protocol — promote
  to a real Surface if a third live pane appears. `apps/desktop/src/shell/surfaces/`.
- [low] "Add to agent" on a git-changed file assumes cwd === repo root. `FilesPane.tsx`.
- [low] Terminal tool completion is sentinel-heuristic; a structured exec channel
  would be cleaner. `packages/plugin-terminal/`.

## Desktop / apps & send-to-chat

- [med] `RENDERER_DISPATCHED_METHODS` disjointness is a runtime test, not compile-time
  — a type-level partition would make drift a compile error. `apps/desktop/src/bridge/`.
- [med] `session.send` not reachable by sandboxed apps — the iframe runtime /
  postMessage↔IPC relay doesn't exist yet (only the built-in anonymizer path ships).
  `apps/desktop/src/apps/`.
- [med] NER model E2E only unit-verified — confirm model loads from `moxxy-app://`
  with zero network in a packaged/dev Electron run. `packages/desktop-host/src/apps/`.
- [med] transformers.js ↔ ORT wasm version coupling + installer↔HF asset-path
  coupling — re-verify packaged NER on any bump; keep the two path ends in lockstep.
  `packages/desktop-host/src/apps/registry.ts`.
- [low] No on-disk integrity check for installed app assets — add per-asset sha256
  when the model set stabilizes. `packages/desktop-host/src/apps/`.

## Anonymizer & NER

- [med] Polish NER recall unproven (cross-lingual transfer) — needs a real-Polish-doc
  eval harness or the `jiting/...hrl_onnx` fallback. `packages/anonymizer/`.
- [med] Vite emits a ~21 MB orphan ORT wasm under `dist/assets/` (internal
  `new URL(...)`) on every hot-update bundle — stop the emit via resolve alias /
  `assetsInclude`. `apps/desktop/electron.vite.config.ts`.
- [low] Crypto/secret checksums are structural-only (no crypto dep); no HIPAA
  Safe-Harbor profile; context window is a flat 48 chars. `packages/anonymizer/`.

## Desktop / attachments, settings, providers

- [med] Dropped attachments are invisible — round-trip a notice when
  `authorizeAttachments`/`buildAttachments` rejects/skips. `packages/desktop-host/src/ipc/`.
- [med, consistency] `provider.setEnabled` is fire-and-forget read-merge-write — two
  rapid cross-client toggles can lose one update. `packages/desktop-host/src/ipc/preferences.ts`.
- [low] Configure sheet can't edit a built-in provider's models array; `local`
  provider wizard prompts for a non-existent key (`auth.kind` should be `none`).
  `apps/desktop/src/settings/providers/`.

## Providers & model catalogs

- [med] Codex reasoning isn't round-tripped (`toResponsesInput` drops the reasoning
  block); Anthropic multi-block thinking collapses to one round-trip block. Only
  Anthropic round-trips fully. `packages/plugin-provider-*/`.
- [low] Hardcoded catalogs span 5+ providers and drift — a shared
  OpenAI-compatible-vendor catalog or `/v1/models`-backed refresh would self-update.

## Channels, relay & HTTP

- [low] Desktop channel catalog hand-copies each channel's vault key names +
  config fields (`packages/desktop-host/src/channel-catalog.ts`) so the Channels
  panel can render a form without booting plugin discovery in the Electron main.
  The plugins' `keys.ts` stay the source of truth (a unit test pins the copy). A
  `moxxy channels describe --json` command sourcing it from each `ChannelDef`
  (now that `dedicatedRunner`/`sessionSource`/`requestUrl` are declarative) would
  remove the duplication.
- [low] Desktop-spawned channels are killed on app quit (a best-effort
  `process.once('exit')` SIGTERM in `channel-supervisor.ts`); no cross-restart
  re-adoption of an already-running channel by its status-file pid. Fine for v1
  (no orphans, each session starts clean); revisit if channels should outlive the
  desktop. `packages/desktop-host/src/channel-supervisor.ts`.
- [med] Relay is the single-instance sole remote path — no fallback; needs uptime
  monitoring + redeploy story (decide on an emergency escape hatch). `plugin-tunnel-proxy`.
- [med] Channel→core prod dependency — `plugin-cli`/`plugin-telegram` still import
  core helpers; hoist provider-neutral ones into the SDK. 
- [med] Shared HTTP-channel server base — `createServer`/`listen`/health/routing is
  replicated across `plugin-channel-http`/`-web`/`webhooks`/`ipc-server-ws`/
  `plugin-channel-slack` (the Slack ingest server is a 6th copy); an optional
  `HttpChannelServer` base would dedupe (larger refactor, lower payoff).
- [med, slack v1] Slack channel runs a SINGLE global `busy` single-flight — one
  turn at a time across ALL threads/channels (a 2nd @mention while busy gets a
  "still working" reply and is dropped). Per-thread concurrency (a turn per
  thread, the isolation seam supports it) is deferred. `packages/plugin-channel-slack/`.
- [med, slack v1, security] Slack channel is AUTONOMOUS — allow-list auto-approve
  with no human-in-the-loop (mirrors the HTTP channel). There is no Slack
  Interactivity button-approval flow; the operator must scope `allowedTools`
  narrowly at setup (every auto-approved call is logged). Revisit human-in-the-loop
  via Slack Interactivity (a 2nd Request URL) for v2. `packages/plugin-channel-slack/`.
- [low, slack v1] Slack replies stream as PLAIN TEXT via `chat.update` (no
  Block Kit / mrkdwn formatting, no message split for very long replies). A
  Telegram-style renderer + Block Kit would improve fidelity. `packages/plugin-channel-slack/`.
- [med, security] LAN pairing is cleartext `ws://` (RN/Expo can't trust a self-signed
  cert for a private IP); the secure phone path is the tunnel (`wss://`). Add optional
  `https.Server` + dev-build pinning only if direct-LAN encryption ever matters.
- [low] Web-preview path-prefix rewriting only matters if a non-base-path-aware HTTP
  app appears. `packages/plugin-channel-web/`.
- [low] Telegram rich-formatting is "simple yet powerful" but the powerful half is
  doc-only: the model isn't TOLD about `~~strike~~`/`||spoiler||`/`> [!type]` callouts,
  so it uses them only when a prompt/skill asks. The auto-wins (collapse the tool trace,
  render standard Markdown) need no model awareness. If we want the model to reach for
  collapsible callouts on its own, inject a one-line capability note into the session
  when the Telegram channel is active (no prompt-injection seam for channels exists yet).
  `packages/plugin-telegram/src/format.ts`.
- [low] The final-frame activity collapse (`<blockquote expandable>`) is always-on with
  a fixed 4-line threshold; if anyone wants it off, promote it to a per-chat `/details`
  toggle or a `TelegramChannelOptions` flag. `packages/plugin-telegram/src/render.ts`.

## Workflows

- [med] `awaitInput` barred inside a loop body (needs mid-iteration checkpointing);
  multi-pause stress-tested only to two pauses; concurrent paused runs of the same
  workflow surface as separate asks (UI ordering policy). `packages/plugin-workflows/`.
- [med] Resume relies on the child retained in the runner's in-memory registry — a
  runner restart between pause and resume loses it (checkpoint survives, continue
  fails cleanly); persist/rehydrate is future work. `packages/plugin-workflows/`, `core/subagents`.
- [med] Mobile workflow builder name fields are free-text — populate from
  `workflows.list` like desktop. Add a settings error-row retry if `settings.read`
  failures prove common. `apps/mobile/app/workflow-edit.tsx`.
- [med] Cross-session `afterWorkflow` can't route: the `workflow_completed` event is
  observed in-process by ONLY the runner that ran the parent, so a dependent pinned
  (`targetSessionId`) to a different session is skipped with a warning rather than
  run there. A shared completion queue (mirror the webhooks queue/drain from #333)
  would let any runner pick up its own-target dependents. `packages/cli/src/setup/wire-run-store.ts`.
- [low] No validation that a trigger's `targetSessionId` names a live session: a
  stale/mistyped id silently never fires (schedule owner-gates to an absent runner;
  fileChanged/afterWorkflow skip on every runner). The desktop picker surfaces a
  "(missing)" option, but `webhook_create`/`schedule_create`/workflow YAML can't
  validate without a live-desk registry. `packages/plugin-{webhooks,scheduler}`, `packages/cli`.

## Config / plugins manifest

- [note, RESOLVED 2026-06-25] The three overlapping config stores (flat
  `provider`/`mode`/`compactor` keys + package-keyed `plugins:` map +
  `~/.moxxy/preferences.json`) are unified into one category-grouped `plugins:`
  tree with a critical floor (Pillar 1). Provider/mode/model/disabled now persist
  through `@moxxy/config` writers; `preferences.json` is gone.
- [note, RESOLVED 2026-06-25] Pillar 2 done: the **EventStore** behind the event
  log is now a registry kind (`eventStore`) with a protected JSONL floor and an
  explicit-opt-in trust boundary, behaviour-identical (thin adapter over
  `SessionPersistence`). Pillar 3 (slim-core kernel + publish ~40 plugins +
  init-provisions + desktop seed-pack) remains planned but unstarted. Plan:
  `~/.claude/plans/i-think-we-need-zany-wirth.md`.
- [low, follow-up] EventStore: only the WRITE path routes through the active
  store (`attachSessionPersistence` → `getActive().open()`). The session-scoped
  READS (`restoreSessionEvents`/`readSessionEventPage` in build-session, runner
  session-handlers, mobile host) + cross-session management (`listSessionMetas`/
  `deleteSession`/`seedSessionLog`) still call the standalone JSONL fns. Identical
  while JSONL is the only impl; route them through `getActive()` (and add a
  default-store seam for the no-session listing) when a 2nd store lands.
- [low, dx] plugins-admin/runner/channels persist via raw-YAML `setIn` writers in
  `@moxxy/config/user-config.ts` — the typecheck can't catch a wrong path string;
  keep the round-trip tests honest and grep for `['plugins'` paths on changes.

## CLI / services

- [med, dx] `service install` units break under Electron-as-node (`nodeBin()` returns
  the Electron binary, no `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` → GUI ghost). Detect run-as-node,
  export the env var, prefer the Helper binary. `packages/cli/src/commands/service/common.ts`.
- [med] One-shot CLI commands (`-p`, `schedule run`, `doctor`, `login`, `init`) never
  `close()` — drain persistence before exit. `packages/cli/`.

## Mobile UI (low-priority polish)

- [med] Sending attachments while a turn is in flight is refused (inline payloads
  can't ride the path-based queue) — queue host-side if needed. `apps/mobile/`.
- [low] Misc: theme flip can lag memoized rows (need a `themeVersion` counter);
  `selectWorkspace`/`activeWorkspaceId` misnamed (they select a session); deprecated
  `SafeAreaView`/`expo-blur` hard dep; `toolGroupUi` dead fields; unused `LargeHeader`;
  header rename low-discoverability; composer-minimize overlay gesture not wired.
- [note] EAS build: `eas-build-post-install` runs `pnpm build` on the workspace
  closure; local repro needs wiping both `dist/` AND `*.tsbuildinfo`. `apps/mobile/eas.json`.

## Memory & embeddings

- [med] plugin-memory `EmbeddingIndex` stays separate from the SDK
  `CachedEmbeddingProvider` (different keying/bounding/persistence/eviction) — leave
  as-is; revisit only if `EmbeddingIndex` is reworked anyway. `packages/plugin-memory/`.

## Skills gallery

- [low, ux] `SkillGallery` hand-rolls its search input instead of the shared
  `<SearchBox />` — swap and delete the duplicate. `apps/desktop/src/settings/skills/SkillGallery.tsx`.
