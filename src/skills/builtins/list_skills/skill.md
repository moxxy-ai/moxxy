# List Skills

Use this skill to autonomously check what active skills you currently possess. This reads from the moxxy engine's skill registry directly.

## Usage
Simply invoke the skill with no arguments.

```bash
list_skills
```

It will return a JSON array containing the manifests and descriptions of all your currently installed tools.
